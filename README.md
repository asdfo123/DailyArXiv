| **[BalancEdit: Dynamically Balancing the Generality-Locality Trade-off in Multi-modal Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01343v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts change and previously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as fine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size and complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a more viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically overlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised model performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT, specifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this foundation, we propose BalancEdit, a novel method for balanced model editing that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete, localized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To our knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive results confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal trade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset will be available.</p></details> |  |

Traditional updating methods, like fine-tuning and incremental learning, face challenges such as overfitting and high computational costs. Knowledge Editing (KE) provides a promising alternative but often overlooks the Knowledge Element Overlap (KEO) phenomenon, where multiple triplets share common elements, leading to editing conflicts. We identify the prevalence of KEO in existing KE datasets and show its significant impact on current KE methods, causing performance degradation in handling such triplets. To address this, we propose a new formulation, Knowledge Set Editing (KSE), and introduce SetKE, a method that edits sets of triplets simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that SetKE outperforms existing methods in KEO scenarios on mainstream LLMs. Additionally, we introduce EditSet, a dataset containing KEO triplets, providing a comprehensive benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>The C...</summary><p>The CR version will be updated subsequently</p></details> |
| **[AlphaEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02355v4)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit hallucinations due to incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.7% with a single line of additional code for projection solely. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jianghoucheng/AlphaEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Abstraction of Knowledge Recall in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14496v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained transformer large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong knowledge recall capabilities. This paper investigates the knowledge recall mechanism in LLMs by abstracting it into a functional structure. We propose that during knowledge recall, the model's hidden activation space implicitly entails a function execution process where specific activation vectors align with functional components (Input argument, Function body, and Return values). Specifically, activation vectors of relation-related tokens define a mapping function from subjects to objects, with subject-related token activations serving as input arguments and object-related token activations as return values. For experimental verification, we first design a patching-based knowledge-scoring algorithm to identify knowledge-aware activation vectors as independent functional components. Then, we conduct counter-knowledge testing to examine the independent functional effects of each component on knowledge recall outcomes. From this functional perspective, we improve the contextual knowledge editing approach augmented by activation patching. By rewriting incoherent activations in context, we enable improved short-term memory retention for new knowledge prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Edit LLMs for Long-Tail Biomedical Knowledge?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10421v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has emerged as an effective approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by modifying their internal knowledge. However, their application to the biomedical domain faces unique challenges due to the long-tailed distribution of biomedical knowledge, where rare and infrequent information is prevalent. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study to investigate the effectiveness of knowledge editing methods for editing long-tail biomedical knowledge. Our results indicate that, while existing editing methods can enhance LLMs' performance on long-tail biomedical knowledge, their performance on long-tail knowledge remains inferior to that on high-frequency popular knowledge, even after editing. Our further analysis reveals that long-tail biomedical knowledge contains a significant amount of one-to-many knowledge, where one subject and relation link to multiple objects. This high prevalence of one-to-many knowledge limits the effectiveness of knowledge editing in improving LLMs' understanding of long-tail biomedical knowledge, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to bridge this performance gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Make LLMs Forget: On Reversing In-Context Knowledge Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12586v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context knowledge editing (IKE) enables efficient modification of large language model (LLM) outputs without parameter changes and at zero-cost. However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</p></details> |
| **[CodeUpdateArena: Benchmarking Knowledge Editing on API Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06249v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to synthesize and reason about source code. However, the static nature of these models' knowledge does not reflect the fact that libraries and API functions they invoke are continuously evolving, with functionality being added or changing. While numerous benchmarks evaluate how LLMs can generate code, no prior work has studied how an LLMs' knowledge about code API functions can be updated. To fill this gap, we present CodeUpdateArena, a benchmark for knowledge editing in the code domain. An instance in our benchmark consists of a synthetic API function update paired with a program synthesis example that uses the updated functionality; our goal is to update an LLM to be able to solve this program synthesis example without providing documentation of the update at inference time. Compared to knowledge editing for facts encoded in text, success here is more challenging: a code LLM must correctly reason about the semantics of the modified function rather than just reproduce its syntax. Our dataset is constructed by first prompting GPT-4 to generate atomic and executable function updates. Then, for each update, we generate program synthesis examples whose code solutions are prone to use the update. Our benchmark covers updates of various types to 54 functions from seven diverse Python packages, with a total of 670 program synthesis examples. Our experiments show that prepending documentation of the update to open-source code LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek, CodeLlama) does not allow them to incorporate changes for problem solving, and existing knowledge editing techniques also have substantial room for improvement. We hope our benchmark will inspire new methods for knowledge updating in code LLMs.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[$μ$KE: Matryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01196v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge bases yet are limited by static training data, leading to issues such as hallucinations and safety risks. Editing a model's internal knowledge through the locate-and-edit paradigm has proven a cost-effective alternative to retraining, though current unstructured approaches, especially window-based autoregressive methods, often disrupt the causal dependency between early memory updates and later output tokens. In this work, we first theoretically analyze these limitations and then introduce Matryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing ($\mu$KE), a novel memory update mechanism that preserves such dependencies via a Matryoshka-style objective and adaptive loss coefficients. Empirical evaluations on two models across four benchmarks demonstrate that $\mu$KE improves edit efficacy by up to 12.33% over state-of-the-art methods, and remain robust when applied to diverse formatted edits, underscoring its potential for effective unstructured knowledge editing in LLMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[In-Context Editing: Learning Knowledge from Self-Induced Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11194v4)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In scenarios where language models must incorporate new information efficiently without extensive retraining, traditional fine-tuning methods are prone to overfitting, degraded generalization, and unnatural language generation. To address these limitations, we introduce Consistent In-Context Editing (ICE), a novel approach leveraging the model's in-context learning capability to optimize toward a contextual distribution rather than a one-hot target. ICE introduces a simple yet effective optimization framework for the model to internalize new knowledge by aligning its output distributions with and without additional context. This method enhances the robustness and effectiveness of gradient-based tuning methods, preventing overfitting and preserving the model's integrity. We analyze ICE across four critical aspects of knowledge editing: accuracy, locality, generalization, and linguistic quality, demonstrating its advantages. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of ICE and demonstrate its potential for continual editing, ensuring that the integrity of the model is preserved while updating information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Multi-modal Knowledge Neurons in Pretrained Transformers via Two-stage Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22941v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. Although these models allow for integrated visual and language understanding, they present challenges such as opaque internal processing and the generation of hallucinations and misinformation. Therefore, there is a need for a method to clarify the location of knowledge in MLLMs. In this study, we propose a method to identify neurons associated with specific knowledge using MiniGPT-4, a Transformer-based MLLM. Specifically, we extract knowledge neurons through two stages: activation differences filtering using inpainting and gradient-based filtering using GradCAM. Experiments on the image caption generation task using the MS COCO 2017 dataset, BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore quantitative evaluation, and qualitative evaluation using an activation heatmap showed that our method is able to locate knowledge with higher accuracy than existing methods. This study contributes to the visualization and explainability of knowledge in MLLMs and shows the potential for future knowledge editing and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyEdit: Edit Any Knowledge Encoded in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05628v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[ADS-Edit: A Multimodal Knowledge Editing Dataset for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20756v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving.

| **[CaKE: Circuit-aware Editing Enables Generalizable Knowledge Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16356v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Breaking Boundaries: Investigating the Effects of Model Editing on Cross-linguistic Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11139v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT and GPT has revolutionized NLP, particularly for English, but it has also created linguistic imbalances. This paper strategically identifies the need for linguistic equity by examining several knowledge editing techniques in multilingual contexts. We evaluate the performance of models such as Mistral, TowerInstruct, OpenHathi, Tamil-Llama, and Kan-Llama across languages including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Our research identifies significant discrepancies in normal and merged models concerning cross-lingual consistency. We employ strategies like 'each language for itself' (ELFI) and 'each language for others' (ELFO) to stress-test these models. Our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to overcome linguistic barriers, laying the groundwork for future research in achieving linguistic inclusivity in AI technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 (Industry track)</p></details> |
| **[Precise Localization of Memories: A Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing Technique for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01090v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing aims to update outdated information in Large Language Models (LLMs). A representative line of study is locate-then-edit methods, which typically employ causal tracing to identify the modules responsible for recalling factual knowledge about entities. However, we find these methods are often sensitive only to changes in the subject entity, leaving them less effective at adapting to changes in relations. This limitation results in poor editing locality, which can lead to the persistence of irrelevant or inaccurate facts, ultimately compromising the reliability of LLMs. We believe this issue arises from the insufficient precision of knowledge localization. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing (FiNE) method that enhances editing locality without affecting overall success rates. By precisely identifying and modifying specific neurons within feed-forward networks, FiNE significantly improves knowledge localization and editing. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that FiNE efficiently achieves better overall performance compared to existing techniques, providing new insights into the localization and modification of knowledge within LLMs.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Composable Interventions for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06483v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time interventions for language models can enhance factual accuracy, mitigate harmful outputs, and improve model efficiency without costly retraining. But despite a flood of new methods, different types of interventions are largely developing independently. In practice, multiple interventions must be applied sequentially to the same model, yet we lack standardized ways to study how interventions interact. We fill this gap by introducing composable interventions, a framework to study the effects of using multiple interventions on the same language models, featuring new metrics and a unified codebase. Using our framework, we conduct extensive experiments and compose popular methods from three emerging intervention categories -- Knowledge Editing, Model Compression, and Machine Unlearning. Our results from 310 different compositions uncover meaningful interactions: compression hinders editing and unlearning, composing interventions hinges on their order of application, and popular general-purpose metrics are inadequate for assessing composability. Taken together, our findings showcase clear gaps in composability, suggesting a need for new multi-objective interventions. All of our code is public: https://github.com/hartvigsen-group/composable-interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Resolving UnderEdit & OverEdit with Iterative & Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11895v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in various downstream language tasks, making it crucial to keep their knowledge up-to-date, but both retraining and fine-tuning the model can be costly. Model editing offers an efficient and effective alternative by a single update to only a key subset of model parameters. While being efficient, these methods are not perfect. Sometimes knowledge edits are unsuccessful, i.e., UnderEdit, or the edit contaminated neighboring knowledge that should remain unchanged, i.e., OverEdit. To address these limitations, we propose iterative model editing, based on our hypothesis that a single parameter update is often insufficient, to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to minimize OverEdit. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce UnderEdit up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit up to 6 percentage points across multiple model editing algorithms, LLMs, and benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review @ ACL'25</p></details> |
| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Continuous Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03279v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without the need for costly retraining. Lifelong model editing is the most challenging task that caters to the continuous editing requirements of LLMs. Prior works primarily focus on single or batch editing; nevertheless, these methods fall short in lifelong editing scenarios due to catastrophic knowledge forgetting and the degradation of model performance. Although retrieval-based methods alleviate these issues, they are impeded by slow and cumbersome processes of integrating the retrieved knowledge into the model. In this work, we introduce RECIPE, a RetriEval-augmented ContInuous Prompt lEarning method, to boost editing efficacy and inference efficiency in lifelong learning. RECIPE first converts knowledge statements into short and informative continuous prompts, prefixed to the LLM's input query embedding, to efficiently refine the response grounded on the knowledge. It further integrates the Knowledge Sentinel (KS) that acts as an intermediary to calculate a dynamic threshold, determining whether the retrieval repository contains relevant knowledge. Our retriever and prompt encoder are jointly trained to achieve editing properties, i.e., reliability, generality, and locality. In our experiments, RECIPE is assessed extensively across multiple LLMs and editing datasets, where it achieves superior editing performance. RECIPE also demonstrates its capability to maintain the overall performance of LLMs alongside showcasing fast editing and inference speed.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 main |
| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for Vision Language Models with Low-Rank Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15432v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct inaccurate knowledge, update outdated information, and incorporate new data into Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. This task poses challenges in lifelong scenarios where edits must be continuously applied for real-world applications. While some editors demonstrate strong robustness for lifelong editing in pure LLMs, Vision LLMs (VLLMs), which incorporate an additional vision modality, are not directly adaptable to existing LLM editors. In this paper, we propose LiveEdit, a LIfelong Vision language modEl Edit to bridge the gap between lifelong LLM editing and VLLMs. We begin by training an editing expert generator to independently produce low-rank experts for each editing instance, with the goal of correcting the relevant responses of the VLLM. A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge, thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally, to integrate visually relevant experts, we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation, we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios. Further experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of each module design in LiveEdit.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Accepted |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Lifelong Knowledge Editing in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05683v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keeping large language models factually up-to-date is crucial for deployment, yet costly retraining remains a challenge. Knowledge editing offers a promising alternative, but methods are only tested on small-scale or synthetic edit benchmarks. In this work, we aim to bridge research into lifelong knowledge editing to real-world edits at practically relevant scale. We first introduce WikiBigEdit; a large-scale benchmark of real-world Wikidata edits, built to automatically extend lifelong for future-proof benchmarking. In its first instance, it includes over 500K question-answer pairs for knowledge editing alongside a comprehensive evaluation pipeline. Finally, we use WikiBigEdit to study existing knowledge editing techniques' ability to incorporate large volumes of real-world facts and contrast their capabilities to generic modification techniques such as retrieval augmentation and continual finetuning to acquire a complete picture of the practical extent of current lifelong knowledge editing.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[MindBridge: Scalable and Cross-Model Knowledge Editing via Memory-Augmented Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02701v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing is a technique for efficiently and accurately updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to alleviate obsolescence and correct errors. However, most existing methods overfit to specific models, causing edited knowledge to be discarded during each LLM update and requiring frequent re-editing, which is particularly burdensome in today's rapidly evolving open-source community. To address this issue, we propose the problem of cross-model knowledge editing and introduce MindBridge, a scalable solution inspired by the low coupling between modality processing and LLMs in multi-modal models. MindBridge introduces the novel concept of memory modality, which encodes edited knowledge as an independent modality. It first performs LLM-agnostic pre-training of the memory modality and then integrates it with various LLMs. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs and popular knowledge editing datasets demonstrate that MindBridge achieves superior performance even in editing tens of thousands of knowledge entries and can flexibly adapt to different LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/CrashBugger/MindBridge.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAKE: Steering Activations for Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01751v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Langue Models have been shown to memorize real-world facts, the need to update this knowledge in a controlled and efficient manner arises. Designed with these constraints in mind, Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches propose to alter specific facts in pretrained models. However, they have been shown to suffer from several limitations, including their lack of contextual robustness and their failure to generalize to logical implications related to the fact. To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Knowledge Editing Really Correct Hallucinations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16251v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, a common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure that LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate progress in the field of knowledge editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[MMKE-Bench: A Multimodal Editing Benchmark for Diverse Visual Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19870v2)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing techniques have emerged as essential tools for updating the factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs), allowing them to correct outdated or inaccurate information without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for multimodal knowledge editing primarily focus on entity-level knowledge represented as simple triplets, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world multimodal information. To address this issue, we introduce MMKE-Bench, a comprehensive MultiModal Knowledge Editing Benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to edit diverse visual knowledge in real-world scenarios. MMKE-Bench addresses these limitations by incorporating three types of editing tasks: visual entity editing, visual semantic editing, and user-specific editing. Besides, MMKE-Bench uses free-form natural language to represent and edit knowledge, offering a more flexible and effective format. The benchmark consists of 2,940 pieces of knowledge and 8,363 images across 33 broad categories, with evaluation questions automatically generated and human-verified. We assess five state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods on three prominent LMMs, revealing that no method excels across all criteria, and that visual and user-specific edits are particularly challenging. MMKE-Bench sets a new standard for evaluating the robustness of multimodal knowledge editing techniques, driving progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ICLR2025.

| **[Unlocking Efficient, Scalable, and Continual Knowledge Editing with Basis-Level Representation Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00306v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language tasks. However, they are trained on static corpora and their knowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This motivates the development of knowledge editing methods designed to update certain knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others. To make selective edits, previous efforts often sought to update a small amount of parameters in some specific layer(s) of a LLM. Nonetheless, in challenging scenarios, they still fall short in making successful edits while preserving knowledge irrelevant to the updates simultaneously, resulting in a notable editing-locality trade-off. In this work, we question if the trade-offs are caused by the fact that parameter-based updates have a global effect, i.e., edited parameters affect all inputs indiscriminately. In light of this, we explore the feasibility of representation fine-tuning, which applied some linear update to a few representations in a learned subspace, for knowledge editing. While being effective to enhance an LLM's general ability as demonstrated in the previous work, we theoretically show that this linear update imposes a tension in editing-locality trade-off. Subsequently, BaFT is proposed to break the linearity. BaFT computes a weight for each basis that spans a dimension of the subspace based on the input representation. This input-dependent weighting mechanism allows BaFT to manage different types of knowledge in an adaptive way, thereby achieving a better editing-locality trade-off. Experiments on three LLMs with five editing benchmarks in diverse scenarios show the superiority of our method.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Relation Also Knows: Rethinking the Recall and Editing of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Transformer Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15091v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The storage and recall of factual associations in auto-regressive transformer language models (LMs) have drawn a great deal of attention, inspiring knowledge editing by directly modifying the located model weights. Most editing works achieve knowledge editing under the guidance of existing interpretations of knowledge recall that mainly focus on subject knowledge. However, these interpretations are seriously flawed, neglecting relation information and leading to the over-generalizing problem for editing. In this work, we discover a novel relation-focused perspective to interpret the knowledge recall of transformer LMs during inference and apply it on single knowledge editing to avoid over-generalizing. Experimental results on the dataset supplemented with a new R-Specificity criterion demonstrate that our editing approach significantly alleviates over-generalizing while remaining competitive on other criteria, breaking the domination of subject-focused editing for future research.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |
| **[GeoEdit: Geometric Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19953v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regular updates are essential for maintaining up-to-date knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Consequently, various model editing methods have been developed to update specific knowledge within LLMs. However, training-based approaches often struggle to effectively incorporate new knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Geometric Knowledge Editing (GeoEdit). GeoEdit utilizes the geometric relationships of parameter updates from fine-tuning to differentiate between neurons associated with new knowledge updates and those related to general knowledge perturbations. By employing a direction-aware knowledge identification method, we avoid updating neurons with directions approximately orthogonal to existing knowledge, thus preserving the model's generalization ability. For the remaining neurons, we integrate both old and new knowledge for aligned directions and apply a "forget-then-learn" editing strategy for opposite directions. Additionally, we introduce an importance-guided task vector fusion technique that filters out redundant information and provides adaptive neuron-level weighting, further enhancing model editing performance. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoEdit over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge-based model editing enables precise modifications to the weights of large language models in order to modify the information encoded within. Recent approaches have seen success in enabling recall of edited information for thousands of edits at once. However, these approaches fail to produce edits that account for associated contextual information. We present K-Edit, an effective approach to generating contextually consistent knowledge edits. By using knowledge graphs, which maintain contextual consistency when an edge is edited, we are able to generate additional \textit{contextual edits} that ensure consistency of related information in the language model. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in multi-hop question answering while maintaining the general effectiveness and scalability of model edits.</p></details> |  |

We first show that across different post-training interventions like continuous pre-training, full fine-tuning and LORA-based fine-tuning, the Frobenius norm of the updated matrices always increases. This increasing norm is especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset of matrices are updated in a model . We reveal a consistent phenomenon across various editing techniques, including fine-tuning, hypernetwork-based approaches, and locate-and-edit methods: the norm of the updated matrix invariably increases with successive updates. Such growth disrupts model balance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the model remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of downstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate activation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and is accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which shows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in the representation space compared to the unedited model. With our paper, we highlight the technical challenges with continuous and localized sequential knowledge editing and their implications for maintaining model stability and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at KnowFM @ AAAI 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.01636</p></details> |

However, current knowledge editing methods have limited scalability for lifelong editing. This study explores the fundamental reason why knowledge editing fails in lifelong editing. We begin with the closed-form solution derived from linear associative memory, which underpins state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods. We extend the solution from single editing to lifelong editing, and through rigorous mathematical derivation, identify an interference term in the final solution, suggesting that editing knowledge may impact irrelevant knowledge. Further analysis of the interference term reveals a close relationship with superposition between knowledge representations. When knowledge superposition does not exist in language models, the interference term vanishes, allowing for lossless knowledge editing. Experiments across numerous language models reveal that knowledge superposition is universal, exhibiting high kurtosis, zero mean, and heavy-tailed distributions with clear scaling laws. Ultimately, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that knowledge superposition is the fundamental reason for the failure of lifelong editing. Moreover, this is the first study to investigate knowledge editing from the perspective of superposition and provides a comprehensive observation of superposition across numerous real-world language models.

Methods like prompt-based In-Context Knowledge Editing (IKE) and gradient-based Model Editor Networks (MEND) have been explored but show irregularity and variability; IKE depends on the prompt, leading to variability and sensitivity, while MEND yields inconsistent and gibberish outputs. To address this, we employed Opinion QA Based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), to manipulate the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. After PEFT, models such as Mistral-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-2-7B-chat showed a latent behaviour by generating emojis for certain traits, despite no emojis being present in the PEFT data. For instance, LLaMA-2-7B-chat generated emojis in 99.5\% of extraversion-related test instances, while Mistral-7B-Instruct did so in 92.5\% of openness-related test instances. ICL Explainability analysis indicated that the LLMs used emojis intentionally to express these traits. Mechanistic Interpretability analysis showed that this latent behaviour of LLMs could be traced to specific neurons that became activated or amplified after PEFT. This paper provides a number of novel contributions. First, introducing an Opinion QA dataset for PEFT-driven personality manipulation; second, developing metric models to benchmark LLM personality traits; third, demonstrating PEFT's superiority over IKE in personality manipulation; and finally, analysing and validating emoji usage through explainability methods such as Mechanistic Interpretability and In-context learning Explainability methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper of NAACL 2025 and NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Behavioral Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Everything is Editable: Extend Knowledge Editing to Unstructured Data in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15349v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent knowledge editing methods have primarily focused on modifying structured knowledge in large language models. However, this task setting overlooks the fact that a significant portion of real-world knowledge is stored in an unstructured format, characterized by long-form content, noise, and a complex yet comprehensive nature. Techniques like "local layer key-value storage" and "term-driven optimization", as used in previous methods like MEMIT, are not effective for handling unstructured knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unstructured Knowledge Editing method, namely UnKE, which extends previous assumptions in the layer dimension and token dimension. Firstly, in the layer dimension, we propose non-local block key-value storage to replace local layer key-value storage, increasing the representation ability of key-value pairs and incorporating attention layer knowledge. Secondly, in the token dimension, we replace "term-driven optimization" with "cause-driven optimization", which edits the last token directly while preserving context, avoiding the need to locate terms and preventing the loss of context information. Results on newly proposed unstructured knowledge editing dataset (UnKEBench) and traditional structured datasets demonstrate that UnKE achieves remarkable performance, surpassing strong baselines. In addition, UnKE has robust batch editing and sequential editing capabilities.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge.

Meanwhile, Knowledge Editing (KE) for LLMs has also garnered increased attention due to its ability to manipulate the behaviors of LLMs explicitly, yet leaves the collaborative KE case (in which knowledge edits of multiple parties are aggregated in a privacy-preserving and continual manner) unexamined. To this end, this manuscript dives into the first investigation of collaborative KE, in which we start by carefully identifying the unique three challenges therein, including knowledge overlap, knowledge conflict, and knowledge forgetting. We then propose a non-destructive collaborative KE framework, COLLABEDIT, which employs a novel model merging mechanism to mimic the global KE behavior while preventing the severe performance drop. Extensive experiments on two canonical datasets demonstrate the superiority of COLLABEDIT compared to other destructive baselines, and results shed light on addressing three collaborative KE challenges and future applications.

However, existing methods assume a single-user setting and become inefficient in real-world multi-client scenarios, where decentralized organizations (e.g., hospitals, financial institutions) independently update overlapping knowledge, leading to redundant mediator knowledge vector (MKV) computations and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing (FLEKE), a novel task that enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform LEKE while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. To achieve this, we propose FedEdit, a two-stage framework that optimizes MKV selection and reuse. In the first stage, clients locally apply LEKE and upload the computed MKVs. In the second stage, rather than relying solely on server-based MKV sharing, FLEKE allows clients retrieve relevant MKVs based on cosine similarity, enabling knowledge re-edit and minimizing redundant computations. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedEdit retains over 96% of the performance of non-federated LEKE while significantly outperforming a FedAvg-based baseline by approximately twofold. Besides, we find that MEMIT performs more consistently than PMET in the FLEKE task with our FedEdit framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/zongkaiz/FLEKE.</p></details> |  |

To avoid this, knowledge editing methods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently modifying a very small percentage of parameters. % However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure: when the content related to the edited knowledge occurs in the context, it can inadvertently corrupt other pre-existing knowledge. However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely degraded due to editing. Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure primarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention scores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on specific snippets within the context, which we denote as the Attention Drift phenomenon. To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method Selective Attention Drift Restriction}(SADR), which introduces an additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to restrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue focus on the edited entity. Experiments on five frequently used strong LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where SADR can significantly mitigate Specificity Failure in the predominant knowledge editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, prior methods typically focus on either single-language editing or basic multilingual editing, failing to achieve true cross-linguistic knowledge synchronization. To address this, we present a simple and practical state-of-the-art (SOTA) recipe Cross-Lingual Knowledge Democracy Edit (X-KDE), designed to propagate knowledge from a dominant language to other languages effectively. Our X-KDE comprises two stages: (i) Cross-lingual Edition Instruction Tuning (XE-IT), which fine-tunes the model on a curated parallel dataset to modify in-scope knowledge while preserving unrelated information, and (ii) Target-language Preference Optimization (TL-PO), which applies advanced optimization techniques to ensure consistency across languages, fostering the transfer of updates. Additionally, we contribute a high-quality, cross-lingual dataset, specifically designed to enhance knowledge transfer across languages. Extensive experiments on the Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks show that X-KDE significantly enhances cross-lingual performance, achieving an average improvement of +8.19%, while maintaining high accuracy in monolingual settings.</p></details> |  |

Cross-lingual KE, which requires knowledge edited in one language to generalize across others while preserving unrelated knowledge, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate IKE under zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot setups, incorporating tailored metric-specific demonstrations. Our findings reveal that model scale and demonstration alignment critically govern cross-lingual IKE efficacy, with larger models and tailored demonstrations significantly improving performance. Linguistic properties, particularly script type, strongly influence performance variation across languages, with non-Latin languages underperforming due to issues like language confusion.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |

Existing research on knowledge editing primarily concentrates on monolingual scenarios, neglecting the complexities presented by multilingual contexts and multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, our study introduces MLaKE (Multilingual Language Knowledge Editing), a novel benchmark comprising 4072 multi-hop and 5360 single-hop questions designed to evaluate the adaptability of knowledge editing methods across five languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and German. MLaKE aggregates fact chains from Wikipedia across languages and utilizes LLMs to generate questions in both free-form and multiple-choice. We evaluate the multilingual knowledge editing generalization capabilities of existing methods on MLaKE. Existing knowledge editing methods demonstrate higher success rates in English samples compared to other languages. However, their generalization capabilities are limited in multi-language experiments. Notably, existing knowledge editing methods often show relatively high generalization for languages within the same language family compared to languages from different language families. These results underscore the imperative need for advancements in multilingual knowledge editing and we hope MLaKE can serve as a valuable resource for benchmarking and solution development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at COLING 2025</p></details> |

However, traditional prompt-based techniques for controlling personality often fall short, as they do not effectively mitigate the model's inherent biases. In this paper, we introduce a novel method PALETTE that enhances personality control through knowledge editing. By generating adjustment queries inspired by psychological assessments, our approach systematically adjusts responses to personality-related queries similar to modifying factual knowledge, thereby achieving controlled shifts in personality traits. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our method enables more stable and well-balanced personality control in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

However, the global quantitative role of activation values in shaping outputs remains unclear, hindering further advancements in applications like knowledge editing. Our study first investigates the numerical relationship between neuron activations and model output and discovers the global linear relationship between them through neuron interventions on a knowledge probing dataset. We refer to the gradient of this linear relationship as neuron empirical gradient (NEG), and introduce NeurGrad, an accurate and efficient method for computing NEG. NeurGrad enables quantitative analysis of all neurons in PLMs, advancing our understanding of neurons' controllability. Furthermore, we explore NEG's ability to represent language skills across diverse prompts via skill neuron probing. Experiments on MCEval8k, a multi-choice knowledge benchmark spanning various genres, validate NEG's representational ability. The data and code are released.</p></details> | 29 pages, 19 figures |

MEMIT, a prominent batch editing algorithm, stands out for its capability to perform mass knowledge modifications. However, we uncover a critical limitation that MEMIT's editing efficacy significantly deteriorates when processing batches containing multiple edits sharing the same subject. Our analysis reveals that the root cause lies in MEMIT's key value modeling framework: When multiple facts with the same subject in a batch are modeled through MEMIT's key value mechanism, identical keys (derived from the shared subject) are forced to represent different values (corresponding to different knowledge), resulting in updates conflicts during editing. Addressing this issue, we propose MEMIT-Merge, an enhanced approach that merges value computation processes for facts sharing the same subject, effectively resolving the performance degradation in same-subject batch editing scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that when MEMIT's edit success rate drops to around 50% at larger batch sizes, MEMIT-Merge maintains a success rate exceeding 90%, showcasing remarkable robustness to subject entity collisions.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Most prior works focus on monolingual knowledge editing in English, even though new information can emerge in any language from any part of the world. We propose the Cross-Lingual Multi-Hop Knowledge Editing paradigm, for measuring and analyzing the performance of various SoTA knowledge editing techniques in a cross-lingual setup. Specifically, we create a parallel cross-lingual benchmark, CROLIN-MQUAKE for measuring the knowledge editing capabilities. Our extensive analysis over various knowledge editing techniques uncover significant gaps in performance between the cross-lingual and English-centric setting. Following this, we propose a significantly improved system for cross-lingual multi-hop knowledge editing, CLEVER-CKE. CLEVER-CKE is based on a retrieve, verify and generate knowledge editing framework, where a retriever is formulated to recall edited facts and support an LLM to adhere to knowledge edits. We develop language-aware and hard-negative based contrastive objectives for improving the cross-lingual and fine-grained fact retrieval and verification process used in this framework. Extensive experiments on three LLMs, eight languages, and two datasets show CLEVER-CKE's significant gains of up to 30% over prior methods.</p></details> |  |

Detecting Knowledge Edits in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02765v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing methods (KEs) can update language models' obsolete or inaccurate knowledge learned from pre-training. However, KEs can be used for malicious applications, e.g., inserting misinformation and toxic content. Knowing whether a generated output is based on edited knowledge or first-hand knowledge from pre-training can increase users' trust in generative models and provide more transparency. Driven by this, we propose a novel task: detecting edited knowledge in language models. Given an edited model and a fact retrieved by a prompt from an edited model, the objective is to classify the knowledge as either unedited (based on the pre-training), or edited (based on subsequent editing). We instantiate the task with four KEs, two LLMs, and two datasets. Additionally, we propose using the hidden state representations and the probability distributions as features for the detection. Our results reveal that, using these features as inputs to a simple AdaBoost classifiers establishes a strong baseline. This classifier requires only a limited amount of data and maintains its performance even in cross-domain settings. Last, we find it more challenging to distinguish edited knowledge from unedited but related knowledge, highlighting the need for further research. Our work lays the groundwork for addressing malicious model editing, which is a critical challenge associated with the strong generative capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on Same-Subject Editing, which involves modifying multiple attributes of a single entity to ensure comprehensive and consistent updates to entity-centric knowledge.

To address the lack of relevant editing data for identical subjects in traditional benchmarks, we introduce the $\text{S}^2\text{RKE}$(Same-Subject Related Knowledge Editing) benchmark. Our extensive experiments reveal that only mainstream locate-then-edit methods, such as ROME and MEMIT, exhibit "related knowledge perturbation," where subsequent edits interfere with earlier ones.

These facts can become outdated over time, which has led to the development of knowledge editing methods (KEs) that can change specific facts in LLMs with limited side effects. This position paper argues that editing LLMs poses serious safety risks that have been largely overlooked. First, we note the fact that KEs are widely available, computationally inexpensive, highly performant, and stealthy makes them an attractive tool for malicious actors. Second, we discuss malicious use cases of KEs, showing how KEs can be easily adapted for a variety of malicious purposes. Third, we highlight vulnerabilities in the AI ecosystem that allow unrestricted uploading and downloading of updated models without verification. Fourth, we argue that a lack of social and institutional awareness exacerbates this risk, and discuss the implications for different stakeholders. We call on the community to (i) research tamper-resistant models and countermeasures against malicious model editing, and (ii) actively engage in securing the AI ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study the reasons behind this and scale sequential knowledge editing to 10,000 sequential edits, while maintaining the downstream performance of the original model. We first show that locate-then-edit knowledge editing methods lead to overfitting on the edited facts. We also show that continuous knowledge editing using these methods leads to disproportionate growth in the norm of the edited matrix. We then provide a crucial insight into the inner workings of locate-then-edit methods. We show that norm-growth is a hidden trick employed by these methods that gives larger importance to the output activations produced from the edited layers. With this "importance hacking", the edited layers provide a much larger contributions to the model's output. To mitigate these issues, we present ENCORE - Early stopping and Norm-Constrained Robust knowledge Editing. ENCORE controls for overfitting and the disproportionate norm-growth to enable long-term sequential editing, where we are able to perform up to 10,000 sequential edits without loss of downstream performance. ENCORE is also 61% faster than MEMIT and 64% faster than AlphaEdit on Llama3-8B.</p></details> |  |

While learning intrinsically interpretable models remains a prominent approach, its scalability and flexibility are limited in handling complex tasks or multi-agent dynamics. This paper advocates for direct interpretability, generating post hoc explanations directly from trained models, as a versatile and scalable alternative, offering insights into agents' behaviour, emergent phenomena, and biases without altering models' architectures. We explore modern methods, including relevance backpropagation, knowledge edition, model steering, activation patching, sparse autoencoders and circuit discovery, to highlight their applicability to single-agent, multi-agent, and training process challenges. By addressing MADRL interpretability, we propose directions aiming to advance active topics such as team identification, swarm coordination and sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Heterogeneous Token Overfitting in LLM Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00602v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language tasks. However, they are trained on static corpora and their knowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This motivates the development of knowledge editing (KE) to update specific knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others or compromising their pre-trained capabilities. Previous efforts sought to update a small amount of parameters of a LLM and proved effective for making selective updates. Nonetheless, the edited LLM often exhibits degraded ability to reason about the new knowledge. In this work, we identify a key issue: heterogeneous token overfitting (HTO), where the LLM overfits different tokens in the provided knowledge at varying rates. To tackle this, we propose OVERTONE, a token-level smoothing method that mitigates HTO by adaptively refining the target distribution. Theoretically, OVERTONE offers better parameter updates with negligible computation overhead. It also induces an implicit DPO but does not require preference data pairs. Extensive experiments across four editing methods, two LLMs, and diverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locate-then-edit for Multi-hop Factual Recall under Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06331v3)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The locate-then-edit paradigm has shown significant promise for knowledge editing (KE) in Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous methods perform well on single-hop fact recall tasks, they consistently struggle with multi-hop factual recall tasks involving newly edited knowledge. In this paper, leveraging tools in mechanistic interpretability, we first identify that in multi-hop tasks, LLMs tend to retrieve knowledge with implicit subject information from deeper MLP layers, unlike single-hop tasks, which rely on shallow layers. This distinction explains the poor performance of current methods in multi-hop queries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers with single-hop edit prompts, leaving deeper layers unchanged. To address this, we propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-edit KE approach designed to edit both shallow and deep MLP layers. Beyond single-hop editing prompts, IFMET further incorporates multi-hop editing prompts to locate and modify knowledge across different stages of reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that IFMET significantly improves performance on multi-hop factual recall tasks, overcoming the limitations of previous locate-then-edit methods</p></details> | 24 pages |

To better identify the possibilities and limitations of these approaches, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affect models' factual recall accuracy and diminish their general reasoning abilities. While these studies give broad insights into the potential harms of KE algorithms, e.g., via performance evaluations on benchmarks, we argue little is understood as to why such destructive failures occur. Is it possible KE methods distort representations of concepts beyond the targeted fact, hence hampering abilities at broad? If so, what is the extent of this distortion? Motivated by such questions, we define a novel synthetic task wherein a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a "structured" knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of the graph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on other entities in the graph (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X's siblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models and analysis of extracted representations, we show that KE inadvertently affects representations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevant structures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. We call this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it results in degradation of factual recall and reasoning performance more broadly. To corroborate our findings in a more naturalistic setup, we perform preliminary experiments with pre-trained Llama and Mamba models, reproducing the representation shattering effect therein as well. Overall, our work yields a precise mechanistic hypothesis to explain why KE has adverse effects on model abilities.</p></details> | Under review |

The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

This has made knowledge editing in large language models increasingly important. However, existing knowledge editing methods face several challenges, including parameter localization coupling, imprecise localization, and a lack of dynamic interaction across layers. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge editing method called Knowledge Neuronal Ensemble (KNE). A knowledge neuronal ensemble represents a group of neurons encoding specific knowledge, thus mitigating the issue of frequent parameter modification caused by coupling in parameter localization. The KNE method enhances the precision and accuracy of parameter localization by computing gradient attribution scores for each parameter at each layer. During the editing process, only the gradients and losses associated with the knowledge neuronal ensemble are computed, with error backpropagation performed accordingly, ensuring dynamic interaction and collaborative updates among parameters. Experimental results on three widely used knowledge editing datasets show that the KNE method significantly improves the accuracy of knowledge editing and achieves, or even exceeds, the performance of the best baseline methods in portability and locality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Editing with Dynamic Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13782v2)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the extensive knowledge demands involved. Knowledge editing, which aims to precisely modify the LLMs to incorporate specific knowledge without negatively impacting other unrelated knowledge, offers a potential solution for addressing MHQA challenges with LLMs. However, current solutions struggle to effectively resolve issues of knowledge conflicts. Most parameter-preserving editing methods are hindered by inaccurate retrieval and overlook secondary editing issues, which can introduce noise into the reasoning process of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce KEDKG, a novel knowledge editing method that leverages a dynamic knowledge graph for MHQA, designed to ensure the reliability of answers. KEDKG involves two primary steps: dynamic knowledge graph construction and knowledge graph augmented generation. Initially, KEDKG autonomously constructs a dynamic knowledge graph to store revised information while resolving potential knowledge conflicts. Subsequently, it employs a fine-grained retrieval strategy coupled with an entity and relation detector to enhance the accuracy of graph retrieval for LLM generation. Experimental results on benchmarks show that KEDKG surpasses previous state-of-the-art models, delivering more accurate and reliable answers in environments with dynamic information.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Knowledge Editing through Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17727v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining. To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch. Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities. Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples. Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks. In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining. EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge. We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating.

| **[Joint Knowledge Editing for Information Enrichment and Probability Promotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17872v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge stored in large language models requires timely updates to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world information. To update the knowledge, most knowledge editing methods focus on the low layers, since recent probes into the knowledge recall process reveal that the answer information is enriched in low layers. However, these probes only and could only reveal critical recall stages for the original answers, while the goal of editing is to rectify model's prediction for the target answers. This inconsistency indicates that both the probe approaches and the associated editing methods are deficient. To mitigate the inconsistency and identify critical editing regions, we propose a contrast-based probe approach, and locate two crucial stages where the model behavior diverges between the original and target answers: Information Enrichment in low layers and Probability Promotion in high layers. Building upon the insights, we develop the Joint knowledge Editing for information Enrichment and probability Promotion (JEEP) method, which jointly edits both the low and high layers to modify the two critical recall stages. Considering the mutual interference and growing forgetting due to dual modifications, JEEP is designed to ensure that updates to distinct regions share the same objectives and are complementary. We rigorously evaluate JEEP by editing up to thousands of facts on various models, i.e., GPT-J (6B) and LLaMA (7B), and addressing diverse editing objectives, i.e., adding factual and counterfactual knowledge. In all tested scenarios, JEEP achieves best performances, validating the effectiveness of the revealings of our probe approach and the designs of our editing method. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Eric8932/JEEP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Query-Relevant Neurons in Large Language Models for Long-Form Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10868v4)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) possess vast amounts of knowledge within their parameters, prompting research into methods for locating and editing this knowledge. Previous work has largely focused on locating entity-related (often single-token) facts in smaller models. However, several key questions remain unanswered: (1) How can we effectively locate query-relevant neurons in decoder-only LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral? (2) How can we address the challenge of long-form (or free-form) text generation? (3) Are there localized knowledge regions in LLMs? In this study, we introduce Query-Relevant Neuron Cluster Attribution (QRNCA), a novel architecture-agnostic framework capable of identifying query-relevant neurons in LLMs. QRNCA allows for the examination of long-form answers beyond triplet facts by employing the proxy task of multi-choice question answering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our detected neurons, we build two multi-choice QA datasets spanning diverse domains and languages. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods significantly. Further, analysis of neuron distributions reveals the presence of visible localized regions, particularly within different domains. Finally, we show potential applications of our detected neurons in knowledge editing and neuron-based prediction.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Main Track |

Current multimodal knowledge editing evaluations are limited in scope and potentially biased, focusing on narrow tasks and failing to assess the impact on in-domain samples. To address these issues, we introduce ComprehendEdit, a comprehensive benchmark comprising eight diverse tasks from multiple datasets. We propose two novel metrics: Knowledge Generalization Index (KGI) and Knowledge Preservation Index (KPI), which evaluate editing effects on in-domain samples without relying on AI-synthetic samples. Based on insights from our framework, we establish Hierarchical In-Context Editing (HICE), a baseline method employing a two-stage approach that balances performance across all metrics. This study provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework for multimodal knowledge editing, reveals unique challenges in this field, and offers a baseline method demonstrating improved performance. Our work opens new perspectives for future research and provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective editing techniques for MLLMs. The ComprehendEdit benchmark and implementation code are available at https://github.com/yaohui120/ComprehendEdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version for paper accepted to AAAI 2025.

Previous research indicates that the same knowledge across different languages within LLMs exhibits a degree of shareability. However, most existing MKE methods overlook the connections of the same knowledge between different languages, resulting in knowledge conflicts and limited edit performance. To address this issue, we first investigate how LLMs process multilingual factual knowledge and discover that the same factual knowledge in different languages generally activates a shared set of neurons, which we call language-agnostic factual neurons (LAFNs). These neurons represent the same factual knowledge shared across languages and imply the semantic connections among multilingual knowledge. Inspired by this finding, we propose a new MKE method by Locating and Updating Language-Agnostic Factual Neurons (LU-LAFNs) to edit multilingual knowledge simultaneously, which avoids knowledge conflicts and thus improves edit performance. Experimental results on Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves the best edit performance, indicating the effectiveness and importance of modeling the semantic connections among multilingual knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLIN...</summary><p>COLING 2025 (14 pages, 3 figures, 12 tables)</p></details> |

While recent model editing techniques like Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) show promise, their effectiveness may vary based on the nature of the knowledge being edited. We introduce the concept of ``perplexingness'': the degree to which new knowledge conflicts with an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies and categorical relationships. For instance, editing ``British Shorthair is a kind of cat'' to ``British Shorthair is a kind of dog'' represents a low-perplexingness edit within the same taxonomic level, while editing ``A cat is a kind of animal'' to ``A cat is a kind of plant'' represents a high-perplexingness edit that violates fundamental categorical boundaries. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we introduce HierarchyData, a carefully curated dataset of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories. Through controlled experiments across three models and four editing methods, we demonstrate a strong negative correlation between the perplexingness of new knowledge and the effectiveness of knowledge editing. Our analysis reveals that edits involving more abstract concepts (hypernyms) generally exhibit higher perplexingness and are more resistant to modification than their specific counterparts (hyponyms). These findings highlight a fundamental challenge in LLM knowledge editing: the more a new fact contradicts an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies, the harder it becomes to reliably encode that knowledge.</p></details> |  |

To gain an understanding toward the knowledge in the circuits, we conduct systematic knowledge editing experiments on the circuits of the GPT-2 language model. Our analysis reveals intriguing patterns in how circuits respond to editing attempts, the extent of knowledge distribution across network components, and the architectural composition of knowledge-bearing circuits. These findings offer insights into the complex relationship between model circuits and knowledge representation, deepening the understanding of how information is organized within language models. Our findings offer novel insights into the ``meanings'' of the circuits, and introduce directions for further interpretability and safety research of language models.</p></details> |  |

However, editing commonsense knowledge still faces difficulties, including limited knowledge coverage in existing resources, the infeasibility of annotating labels for an overabundance of commonsense knowledge, and the strict knowledge formats of current editing methods. In this paper, we address these challenges by presenting ConceptEdit, a framework that integrates conceptualization and instantiation into the KE pipeline for LLMs to enhance their commonsense reasoning capabilities. ConceptEdit dynamically diagnoses implausible commonsense knowledge within an LLM using another verifier LLM and augments the source knowledge to be edited with conceptualization for stronger generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with ConceptEdit successfully generate commonsense knowledge with improved plausibility compared to other baselines and achieve stronger performance across multiple question answering benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates how mechanistic interpretability -- which, in part, aims to identify model components (circuits) associated to specific interpretable mechanisms that make up a model capability -- can improve the precision and effectiveness of editing and unlearning. We find a stark difference in unlearning and edit robustness when training components localized by different methods. We highlight an important distinction between methods that localize components based primarily on preserving outputs, and those finding high level mechanisms with predictable intermediate states. In particular, localizing edits/unlearning to components associated with the lookup-table mechanism for factual recall 1) leads to more robust edits/unlearning across different input/output formats, and 2) resists attempts to relearn the unwanted information, while also reducing unintended side effects compared to baselines, on both a sports facts dataset and the CounterFact dataset across multiple models. We also find that certain localized edits disrupt the latent knowledge in the model more than any other baselines, making unlearning more robust to various attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 45 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods for such knowledge editing still face difficulties with multi-hop questions that require accurate fact identification and sequential logical reasoning, particularly among numerous fact updates. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Graph Memory-based Editing for Large Language Models (GMeLLo), a straightforward and effective method that merges the explicit knowledge representation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the linguistic flexibility of LLMs. Beyond merely leveraging LLMs for question answering, GMeLLo employs these models to convert free-form language into structured queries and fact triples, facilitating seamless interaction with KGs for rapid updates and precise multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that GMeLLo significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge editing methods in the multi-hop question answering benchmark, MQuAKE, especially in scenarios with extensive knowledge edits.</p></details> |  |

However, even the most advanced LLMs4Code can inevitably contain incorrect or outdated code knowledge. Due to the high cost of training LLMs4Code, it is impractical to re-train the models for fixing these problematic code knowledge. Model editing is a new technical field for effectively and efficiently correcting erroneous knowledge in LLMs, where various model editing techniques and benchmarks have been proposed recently. Despite that, a comprehensive study that thoroughly compares and analyzes the performance of the state-of-the-art model editing techniques for adapting the knowledge within LLMs4Code across various code-related tasks is notably absent. To bridge this gap, we perform the first systematic study on applying state-of-the-art model editing approaches to repair the inaccuracy of LLMs4Code. To that end, we introduce a benchmark named CLMEEval, which consists of two datasets, i.e., CoNaLa-Edit (CNLE) with 21K+ code generation samples and CodeSearchNet-Edit (CSNE) with 16K+ code summarization samples. With the help of CLMEEval, we evaluate six advanced model editing techniques on three LLMs4Code: CodeLlama (7B), CodeQwen1.5 (7B), and Stable-Code (3B). Our findings include that the external memorization-based GRACE approach achieves the best knowledge editing effectiveness and specificity (the editing does not influence untargeted knowledge), while generalization (whether the editing can generalize to other semantically-identical inputs) is a universal challenge for existing techniques. Furthermore, building on in-depth case analysis, we introduce an enhanced version of GRACE called A-GRACE, which incorporates contrastive learning to better capture the semantics of the inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE2025.

Meanwhile, LLMs have also demonstrated excellent multilingual capabilities, which can express the learned knowledge in multiple languages. However, the knowledge storage mechanism in LLMs still remains mysterious. Some researchers attempt to demystify the factual knowledge in LLMs from the perspective of knowledge neurons, and subsequently discover language-agnostic knowledge neurons that store factual knowledge in a form that transcends language barriers. However, the preliminary finding suffers from two limitations: 1) High Uncertainty in Localization Results. Existing study only uses a prompt-based probe to localize knowledge neurons for each fact, while LLMs cannot provide consistent answers for semantically equivalent queries. Thus, it leads to inaccurate localization results with high uncertainty. 2) Lack of Analysis in More Languages. The study only analyzes language-agnostic knowledge neurons on English and Chinese data, without exploring more language families and languages. Naturally, it limits the generalizability of the findings. To address aforementioned problems, we first construct a new benchmark called Rephrased Multilingual LAMA (RML-LAMA), which contains high-quality cloze-style multilingual parallel queries for each fact. Then, we propose a novel method named Multilingual Integrated Gradients with Uncertainty Estimation (MATRICE), which quantifies the uncertainty across queries and languages during knowledge localization. Extensive experiments show that our method can accurately localize language-agnostic knowledge neurons. We also further investigate the role of language-agnostic knowledge neurons in cross-lingual knowledge editing, knowledge enhancement and new knowledge injection.</p></details> |  |

Recently, there has been growing interest in extending knowledge editing from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate both textual and visual information, introducing additional editing complexities. Existing multimodal knowledge editing works primarily focus on text-oriented, coarse-grained scenarios, failing to address the unique challenges posed by multimodal contexts. In this paper, we propose a visual-oriented, fine-grained multimodal knowledge editing task that targets precise editing in images with multiple interacting entities. We introduce the Fine-Grained Visual Knowledge Editing (FGVEdit) benchmark to evaluate this task. Moreover, we propose a Multimodal Scope Classifier-based Knowledge Editor (MSCKE) framework. MSCKE leverages a multimodal scope classifier that integrates both visual and textual information to accurately identify and update knowledge related to specific entities within images. This approach ensures precise editing while preserving irrelevant information, overcoming the limitations of traditional text-only editing methods. Extensive experiments on the FGVEdit benchmark demonstrate that MSCKE outperforms existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness in solving the complex challenges of multimodal knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |

However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can give a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work (v5): we have updated the Table 4 results after optimizing certain methods (related to AdaLoRA) and fixing computational bugs (related to ROME and MEMIT) in the EasyEdit.

This is particularly true when updating LLMs with datasets that necessitate domain-expert reasoning across extensive texts, despite limited samples. We termed the scenario as the Few-Shot Domain-Expert Reasoning for Updating LLMs (FDoR-UL). Traditional methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are inadequate for addressing this critical issue, particularly evident in our exploration of a specific medical dataset that epitomizes the distinct needs of FDoR-UL. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a Sequential Fusion method to integrate knowledge from complex contexts into LLMs. This method employs a two-stage framework: initially leveraging general LLMs to perform relation extraction for knowledge acquisition from complex texts, followed by updating domain-specific LLMs through Knowledge Editing (KE). Employing our method, domain-specific LLMs achieved a 71.7% accuracy (an average gain of 39.1%) in question-answering tasks. Furthermore, we expanded our evaluation to a novel economics-management dataset we developed, where our method achieved a 75.0% accuracy (an average gain of 45.0%). These findings underscore the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach in FDoR-UL across various domains.</p></details> | Working in progress |
| **[DeepEdit: Knowledge Editing as Decoding with Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10471v5)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to edit the knowledge in multi-step reasoning has become the major challenge in the knowledge editing (KE) of large language models (LLMs). The difficulty arises because the hallucinations of LLMs during multi-step reasoning often lead to incorrect use of new knowledge and incorrect answers. To address this issue, we design decoding constraints to "regulate" LLMs' reasoning, enhancing logical coherence when incorporating new knowledge. We propose a new KE framework: DEEPEDIT (Depth-first Search-based Constrained Decoding for Knowledge Editing), which enhances LLMs's ability to generate coherent reasoning chains with new knowledge through depth-first search. Our search selects the most important knowledge that satisfies our constraints as the reasoning step to efficiently increase the reasoning depth. In addition to DEEPEDIT, we propose two new KE benchmarks: MQUAKE-2002 and MQUAKE-HARD, which provide more precise and challenging assessments of KE approaches. Qualitatively, DEEPEDIT enables LLMs to produce succinct and coherent reasoning chains involving new knowledge. Quantitatively, it yields significant improvements on multiple KE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the setting of this task overlooks a significant portion of commonsense knowledge based on free-text in the real world, characterized by broad knowledge scope, long content and non instantiation. The editing objects of previous methods (e.g., MEMIT) were single token or entity, which were not suitable for commonsense knowledge in free-text form. To address the aforementioned challenges, we conducted experiments from two perspectives: knowledge localization and knowledge editing. Firstly, we introduced Knowledge Localization for Free-Text(KLFT) method, revealing the challenges associated with the distribution of commonsense knowledge in MLP and Attention layers, as well as in decentralized distribution. Next, we propose a Dynamics-aware Editing Method(DEM), which utilizes a Dynamics-aware Module to locate the parameter positions corresponding to commonsense knowledge, and uses Knowledge Editing Module to update knowledge. The DEM method fully explores the potential of the MLP and Attention layers, and successfully edits commonsense knowledge based on free-text. The experimental results indicate that the DEM can achieve excellent editing performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, recent research has found that edited models often exhibit varying degrees of performance degradation. The reasons behind this phenomenon and potential solutions have not yet been provided. In order to investigate the reasons for the performance decline of the edited model and optimize the editing method, this work explores the underlying reasons from both data and model perspectives. Specifically, 1) from a data perspective, to clarify the impact of data on the performance of editing models, this paper first constructs a Multi-Question Dataset (MQD) to evaluate the impact of different types of editing data on model performance. The performance of the editing model is mainly affected by the diversity of editing targets and sequence length, as determined through experiments. 2) From a model perspective, this article explores the factors that affect the performance of editing models. The results indicate a strong correlation between the L1-norm of the editing model layer and the editing accuracy, and clarify that this is an important factor leading to the bottleneck of editing performance. Finally, in order to improve the performance of the editing model, this paper further proposes a Dump for Sequence (D4S) method, which successfully overcomes the previous editing bottleneck by reducing the L1-norm of the editing layer, allowing users to perform multiple effective edits and minimizing model damage.

| **[Towards Unified Multimodal Editing with Enhanced Knowledge Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19872v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The swift advancement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) also presents significant challenges for effective knowledge editing. Current methods, including intrinsic knowledge editing and external knowledge resorting, each possess strengths and weaknesses, struggling to balance the desired properties of reliability, generality, and locality when applied to MLLMs. In this paper, we propose UniKE, a novel multimodal editing method that establishes a unified perspective and paradigm for intrinsic knowledge editing and external knowledge resorting. Both types of knowledge are conceptualized as vectorized key-value memories, with the corresponding editing processes resembling the assimilation and accommodation phases of human cognition, conducted at the same semantic levels. Within such a unified framework, we further promote knowledge collaboration by disentangling the knowledge representations into the semantic and truthfulness spaces. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, which ensures that the post-edit MLLM simultaneously maintains excellent reliability, generality, and locality.

Previous benchmarks have not systematically analyzed the performance of editing methods in correcting these two error types. To better represent and correct these errors, we decompose multimodal knowledge into its visual and textual components. Different error types correspond to different editing formats, which edit distinct parts of the multimodal knowledge. We present MC-MKE, a fine-grained Multimodal Knowledge Editing benchmark emphasizing Modality Consistency. Our benchmark facilitates independent correction of misreading and misrecognition errors by editing the corresponding knowledge component. We evaluate four multimodal knowledge editing methods on MC-MKE, revealing their limitations, particularly in terms of modality consistency. Our work highlights the challenges posed by multimodal knowledge editing and motivates further research in developing effective techniques for this task.</p></details> |  |

Compared to this, editing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) faces extra challenges from diverse data modalities and complicated model components, and data for LVLMs editing are limited. The existing LVLM editing benchmark, which comprises three metrics (Reliability, Locality, and Generality), falls short in the quality of synthesized evaluation images and cannot assess whether models apply edited knowledge in relevant content. Therefore, we employ more reliable data collection methods to construct a new Large $\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage Model $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{B}$enchmark, $\textbf{VLKEB}$, and extend the Portability metric for more comprehensive evaluation. Leveraging a multi-modal knowledge graph, our image data are bound with knowledge entities. This can be further used to extract entity-related knowledge, which constitutes the base of editing data. We conduct experiments of different editing methods on five LVLMs, and thoroughly analyze how do they impact the models. The results reveal strengths and deficiencies of these methods and hopefully provide insights for future research.

These parameterized facts enable realistic image generation, but they may become obsolete over time, thereby misrepresenting the current state of the world. Knowledge editing techniques aim to update model knowledge in a targeted way. However, facing the dual challenges posed by inadequate editing datasets and unreliable evaluation criterion, the development of T2I knowledge editing encounter difficulties in effectively generalizing injected knowledge. In this work, we design a T2I knowledge editing framework by comprehensively spanning on three phases: First, we curate a dataset \textbf{CAKE}, comprising paraphrase and multi-object test, to enable more fine-grained assessment on knowledge generalization. Second, we propose a novel criterion, \textbf{adaptive CLIP threshold}, to effectively filter out false successful images under the current criterion and achieve reliable editing evaluation. Finally, we introduce \textbf{MPE}, a simple but effective approach for T2I knowledge editing. Instead of tuning parameters, MPE precisely recognizes and edits the outdated part of the conditioning text-prompt to accommodate the up-to-date knowledge. A straightforward implementation of MPE (Based on in-context learning) exhibits better overall performance than previous model editors. We hope these efforts can further promote faithful evaluation of T2I knowledge editing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP24 Findings.

However, recent studies have identified side effects, such as knowledge distortion and the deterioration of general abilities, that have emerged after editing. Despite these findings, evaluating the pitfalls of knowledge editing often relies on inconsistent metrics and benchmarks, lacking a uniform standard. In response, this survey presents a comprehensive study of these side effects, providing a unified perspective on the challenges of knowledge editing in LLMs by conducting experiments with consistent metrics and benchmarks. Additionally, we review related works and outline potential research directions to address these limitations. Our survey highlights the limitations of current knowledge editing methods, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the inner knowledge structures of LLMs and improved knowledge editing methods.

In order to address these challenges, researchers have pursued two primary strategies, knowledge editing and retrieval augmentation, to enhance LLMs by incorporating external information from different aspects. Nevertheless, there is still a notable absence of a comprehensive survey. In this paper, we propose a review to discuss the trends in integration of knowledge and large language models, including taxonomy of methods, benchmarks, and applications. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of different methods and point out potential research directions in the future.

| **[EcomEdit: An Automated E-commerce Knowledge Editing Framework for Enhanced Product and Purchase Intention Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14276v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing (KE) aims to correct and update factual information in Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure accuracy and relevance without computationally expensive fine-tuning. Though it has been proven effective in several domains, limited work has focused on its application within the e-commerce sector. However, there are naturally occurring scenarios that make KE necessary in this domain, such as the timely updating of product features and trending purchase intentions by customers, which necessitate further exploration. In this paper, we pioneer the application of KE in the e-commerce domain by presenting ECOMEDIT, an automated e-commerce knowledge editing framework tailored for e-commerce-related knowledge and tasks. Our framework leverages more powerful LLMs as judges to enable automatic knowledge conflict detection and incorporates conceptualization to enhance the semantic coverage of the knowledge to be edited. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ECOMEDIT in improving LLMs' understanding of product descriptions and purchase intentions. We also show that LLMs, after our editing, can achieve stronger performance on downstream e-commerce tasks.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning these models for specific tasks typically involves updating all parameters, which is resource-intensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the popular LoRA family, introduce low-rank matrices to learn only a few parameters efficiently. However, during inference, the product of these matrices updates all pre-trained parameters, complicating tasks like knowledge editing that require selective updates. We propose a novel PEFT method, which conducts \textbf{r}ow and c\textbf{o}lumn-wise spar\textbf{se} \textbf{lo}w-\textbf{r}ank \textbf{a}daptation (RoseLoRA), to address this challenge. RoseLoRA identifies and updates only the most important parameters for a specific task, maintaining efficiency while preserving other model knowledge. By adding a sparsity constraint on the product of low-rank matrices and converting it to row and column-wise sparsity, we ensure efficient and precise model updates. Our theoretical analysis guarantees the lower bound of the sparsity with respective to the matrix product. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks across twenty datasets demonstrate that RoseLoRA outperforms baselines in both general fine-tuning and knowledge editing tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 main |
| **[O-Edit: Orthogonal Subspace Editing for Language Model Sequential Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11469v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) acquire knowledge during pre-training, but over time, this knowledge may become incorrect or outdated, necessitating updates after training. Knowledge editing techniques address this issue without the need for costly re-training. However, most existing methods are designed for single edits, and as the number of edits increases, they often cause a decline in the model's overall performance, posing significant challenges for sequential editing. To overcome this, we propose Orthogonal Subspace Editing, O-Edit. This algorithm orthogonalizes the direction of each knowledge update, minimizing interference between successive updates and reducing the impact of new updates on unrelated knowledge. Our approach does not require replaying previously edited data and processes each edit knowledge on time. It can perform thousands of edits on mainstream LLMs, achieving an average performance improvement that is 4.2 times better than existing methods while effectively preserving the model's performance on downstream tasks, all with minimal additional parameter overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Untying the Reversal Curse via Bidirectional Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10322v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) store massive factual knowledge within their parameters. But existing LLMs are prone to hallucinate unintended text due to false or outdated knowledge. Since retraining LLMs is resource intensive, there has been a growing interest in the concept of model editing. Despite the emergence of benchmarks and approaches, these unidirectional editing and evaluation have failed to explore the reversal curse. Intuitively, if "The capital of France is" is edited to be a counterfact "London" within a model, then it should be able to naturally reason and recall the reverse fact, i.e., "London is the capital of" followed by "France" instead of "England". In this paper, we study bidirectional language model editing, aiming to provide rigorous model editing evaluation to assess if edited LLMs can recall the editing knowledge bidirectionally. A new evaluation metric of reversibility is introduced, and a benchmark dubbed as Bidirectional Assessment for Knowledge Editing (BAKE) is constructed to evaluate the reversibility of edited models in recalling knowledge in the reverse direction of editing. We surprisingly observe that while current editing methods and LLMs can effectively recall editing facts in the direction of editing, they suffer serious deficiencies when evaluated in the reverse direction. To mitigate the reversal curse, a method named Bidirectionally Inversible Relationship moDeling (BIRD) is proposed. A set of editing objectives that incorporate bidirectional relationships between subject and object into the updated model weights are designed. Experiments show that BIRD improves the performance of four representative LLMs of different sizes via question answering and judgement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Keys to Robust Edits: from Theoretical Insights to Practical Advances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09338v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized knowledge storage and retrieval, but face challenges with conflicting and outdated information. Knowledge editing techniques have been proposed to address these issues, yet they struggle with robustness tests involving long contexts, paraphrased subjects, and continuous edits. This work investigates the cause of these failures in locate-and-edit methods, offering theoretical insights into their key-value modeling and deriving mathematical bounds for robust and specific edits, leading to a novel 'group discussion' conceptual model for locate-and-edit methods. Empirical analysis reveals that keys used by current methods fail to meet robustness and specificity requirements. To address this, we propose a Robust Edit Pathway (REP) that disentangles editing keys from LLMs' inner representations. Evaluations on LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B using the CounterFact dataset show that REP significantly improves robustness across various metrics, both in-domain and out-of-domain, with minimal trade-offs in success rate and locality. Our findings advance the development of reliable and flexible knowledge updating in LLMs.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Mitigating Gender Bias in Code Large Language Models via Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07820v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, with the maturation of large language model (LLM) technology and the emergence of high-quality programming code datasets, researchers have become increasingly confident in addressing the challenges of program synthesis automatically. However, since most of the training samples for LLMs are unscreened, it is inevitable that LLMs' performance may not align with real-world scenarios, leading to the presence of social bias. To evaluate and quantify the gender bias in code LLMs, we propose a dataset named CodeGenBias (Gender Bias in the Code Generation) and an evaluation metric called FB-Score (Factual Bias Score) based on the actual gender distribution of correlative professions. With the help of CodeGenBias and FB-Score, we evaluate and analyze the gender bias in eight mainstream Code LLMs. Previous work has demonstrated that model editing methods that perform well in knowledge editing have the potential to mitigate social bias in LLMs. Therefore, we develop a model editing approach named MG-Editing (Multi-Granularity model Editing), which includes the locating and editing phases. Our model editing method MG-Editing can be applied at five different levels of model parameter granularity: full parameters level, layer level, module level, row level, and neuron level. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate that our MG-Editing can effectively mitigate the gender bias in code LLMs while maintaining their general code generation capabilities, but also showcase its excellent generalization. At the same time, the experimental results show that, considering both the gender bias of the model and its general code generation capability, MG-Editing is most effective when applied at the row and neuron levels of granularity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Overfitting in Large Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07819v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has been proposed as an effective method for updating and correcting the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing editing methods often struggle with complex tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we identify and investigate the phenomenon of Editing Overfit, where edited models assign disproportionately high probabilities to the edit target, hindering the generalization of new knowledge in complex scenarios. We attribute this issue to the current editing paradigm, which places excessive emphasis on the direct correspondence between the input prompt and the edit target for each edit sample. To further explore this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, EVOKE (EValuation of Editing Overfit in Knowledge Editing), along with fine-grained evaluation metrics. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Editing Overfit is prevalent in current editing methods and that common overfitting mitigation strategies are of limited effectiveness in knowledge editing. To overcome this, inspired by LLMs' knowledge recall mechanisms, we propose a new plug-and-play strategy called Learn to Inference (LTI), which introduce a Multi-stage Inference Constraint module to guide the edited models in recalling new knowledge similarly to how unedited LLMs leverage knowledge through in-context learning. Extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks validate the effectiveness of LTI in mitigating Editing Overfit.</p></details> |  |

However, its current evaluations deviate significantly from practice: their knowledge updates solely consist of structured facts derived from meticulously crafted datasets, instead of practical sources -- unstructured texts like news articles, and they often overlook practical real-world knowledge updates. To address these issues, in this paper we propose AKEW (Assessing Knowledge Editing in the Wild), a new practical benchmark for knowledge editing. AKEW fully covers three editing settings of knowledge updates: structured facts, unstructured texts as facts, and extracted triplets. It further introduces new datasets featuring both counterfactual and real-world knowledge updates. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the considerable gap between state-of-the-art knowledge-editing methods and practical scenarios. Our analyses further highlight key insights to motivate future research for practical knowledge editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

Current approaches and evaluations merely explore the instance-level editing, while whether LLMs possess the capability to modify concepts remains unclear. This paper pioneers the investigation of editing conceptual knowledge for LLMs, by constructing a novel benchmark dataset ConceptEdit and establishing a suite of new metrics for evaluation. The experimental results reveal that, although existing editing methods can efficiently modify concept-level definition to some extent, they also have the potential to distort the related instantial knowledge in LLMs, leading to poor performance.

Namely, when a single fact is edited, the model struggles to accurately update the related facts in a sequence, which is evaluated by multi-hop questions linked to a chain of related facts. Recent strategies have moved away from traditional parameter updates to more flexible, less computation-intensive methods, proven to be more effective in addressing the ripple effect. In-context learning (ICL) editing uses a simple demonstration `Imagine that + new fact` to guide LLMs, but struggles with complex multi-hop questions as the new fact alone fails to specify the chain of facts involved in such scenarios. Besides, memory-based editing maintains additional storage for all edits and related facts, requiring continuous updates to stay effective. As a result of these design limitations, the challenge remains, with the highest accuracy being only 33.8% on the MQuAKE-cf benchmarks for Vicuna-7B. To address this, we propose RippleCOT, a novel ICL editing approach integrating Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning. RippleCOT structures demonstrations as `newfact, question, thought, answer`, incorporating a thought component to identify and decompose the multi-hop logic within questions. This approach effectively guides the model through complex multi-hop questions with chains of related facts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RippleCOT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ripple effect, achieving accuracy gains ranging from 7.8% to 87.1%.</p></details> | EMNLP findings |
| **[Is Factuality Enhancement a Free Lunch For LLMs? Better Factuality Can Lead to Worse Context-Faithfulness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00216v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the modern tools of choice for text understanding and generation, large language models (LLMs) are expected to accurately output answers by leveraging the input context. This requires LLMs to possess both context-faithfulness and factual accuracy. Extensive efforts have been made to enable better outputs from LLMs by mitigating hallucinations through factuality enhancement methods. However, they also pose risks of hindering context-faithfulness, as factuality enhancement can lead LLMs to become overly confident in their parametric knowledge, causing them to overlook the relevant input context. In this work, we argue that current factuality enhancement methods can significantly undermine the context-faithfulness of LLMs. We first revisit the current factuality enhancement methods and evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing factual accuracy. Next, we evaluate their performance on knowledge editing tasks to assess the potential impact on context-faithfulness. The experimental results reveal that while these methods may yield inconsistent improvements in factual accuracy, they also cause a more severe decline in context-faithfulness, with the largest decrease reaching a striking 69.7\%. To explain these declines, we analyze the hidden states and logit distributions for the tokens representing new knowledge and parametric knowledge respectively, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Our finding highlights the complex trade-offs inherent in enhancing LLMs. Therefore, we recommend that more research on LLMs' factuality enhancement make efforts to reduce the sacrifice of context-faithfulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precision Knowledge Editing: Enhancing Safety in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03772v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but they also pose risks related to the generation of toxic or harmful content. This work introduces Precision Knowledge Editing (PKE), an advanced technique that builds upon existing knowledge editing methods to more effectively identify and modify toxic parameter regions within LLMs. By leveraging neuron weight tracking and activation pathway tracing, PKE achieves finer granularity in toxic content management compared to previous methods like Detoxifying Instance Neuron Modification (DINM). Our experiments demonstrate that PKE significantly reduces the attack success rate (ASR) across various models, including Llama2-7b and Llama-3-8b-instruct, while maintaining overall model performance. Additionally, we also compared the performance of some closed-source models (gpt-4-0613 and Claude 3 Sonnet) in our experiments, and found that models adjusted using our method far outperformed the closed-source models in terms of safety. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to make LLMs safer and more reliable for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Their knowledge is then commonly evaluated using static benchmarks. However, factual knowledge is generally subject to time-sensitive changes, and static benchmarks cannot address those cases. We present an approach to dynamically evaluate the knowledge in LLMs and their time-sensitiveness against Wikidata, a publicly available up-to-date knowledge graph. We evaluate the time-sensitive knowledge in twenty-four private and open-source LLMs, as well as the effectiveness of four editing methods in updating the outdated facts. Our results show that 1) outdatedness is a critical problem across state-of-the-art LLMs; 2) LLMs output inconsistent answers when prompted with slight variations of the question prompt; and 3) the performance of the state-of-the-art knowledge editing algorithms is very limited, as they can not reduce the cases of outdatedness and output inconsistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Knowledge Editing Types in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19663v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient technology for updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs), attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of effective measures to prevent the malicious misuse of this technology, which could lead to harmful edits in LLMs. These malicious modifications could cause LLMs to generate toxic content, misleading users into inappropriate actions. In front of this risk, we introduce a new task, Knowledge Editing Type Identification (KETI), aimed at identifying different types of edits in LLMs, thereby providing timely alerts to users when encountering illicit edits. As part of this task, we propose KETIBench, which includes five types of harmful edits covering most popular toxic types, as well as one benign factual edit. We develop four classical classification models and three BERT-based models as baseline identifiers for both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our experimental results, across 42 trials involving two models and three knowledge editing methods, demonstrate that all seven baseline identifiers achieve decent identification performance, highlighting the feasibility of identifying malicious edits in LLMs. Additional analyses reveal that the performance of the identifiers is independent of the reliability of the knowledge editing methods and exhibits cross-domain generalization, enabling the identification of edits from unknown sources. All data and code are available in https://github.com/xpq-tech/KETI. Warning: This paper contains examples of toxic text.</p></details> | Under review |

To maintain relevance and accuracy of LLMs, model editing has emerged as a pivotal research area. While these methods hold promise, they can also produce unintended side effects. Their underlying factors and causes remain largely unexplored. This paper delves into a critical factor-question type-by categorizing model editing questions. Our findings reveal that the extent of performance degradation varies significantly across different question types, providing new insights for experimental design in knowledge editing. Furthermore, we investigate whether insights from smaller models can be extrapolated to larger models. Our results indicate discrepancies in findings between models of different sizes, suggesting that insights from smaller models may not necessarily apply to larger models. Additionally, we examine the impact of batch size on side effects, discovering that increasing the batch size can mitigate performance drops.</p></details> |  |

Due to computational constraints, current attribution techniques struggle to operate at neuron level. In this paper, we propose a static method for pinpointing significant neurons. Compared to seven other methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance across three metrics. Additionally, since most static methods typically only identify "value neurons" directly contributing to the final prediction, we propose a method for identifying "query neurons" which activate these "value neurons". Finally, we apply our methods to analyze six types of knowledge across both attention and feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Our method and analysis are helpful for understanding the mechanisms of knowledge storage and set the stage for future research in knowledge editing.

Knowledge Editing (KE) aims to overcome this challenge using weight updates that do not require expensive retraining. We propose treating KE as an LLM alignment problem. Toward this goal, we introduce Knowledge Direct Preference Optimization (KDPO), a variation of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that is more effective for knowledge modifications. Our method is based on an online approach that continually updates the knowledge stored in the model. We use the current knowledge as a negative sample and the new knowledge we want to introduce as a positive sample in a process called DPO. We also use teacher-forcing for negative sample generation and optimize using the positive sample, which helps maintain localized changes. We tested our KE method on various datasets and models, comparing it to several cutting-edge methods, with 100 and 500 sequential edits. Additionally, we conducted an ablation study comparing our method to the standard DPO approach. Our experimental results show that our modified DPO method allows for more refined KE, achieving similar or better performance compared to previous methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16218v4)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed both the academic and industrial landscapes due to their remarkable capacity to understand, analyze, and generate texts based on their vast knowledge and reasoning ability. Nevertheless, one major drawback of LLMs is their substantial computational cost for pre-training due to their unprecedented amounts of parameters. The disadvantage is exacerbated when new knowledge frequently needs to be introduced into the pre-trained model. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective and efficient techniques to update pre-trained LLMs. Traditional methods encode new knowledge in pre-trained LLMs through direct fine-tuning. However, naively re-training LLMs can be computationally intensive and risks degenerating valuable pre-trained knowledge irrelevant to the update in the model. Recently, Knowledge-based Model Editing (KME) has attracted increasing attention, which aims to precisely modify the LLMs to incorporate specific knowledge, without negatively influencing other irrelevant knowledge. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive and in-depth overview of recent advances in the field of KME. We first introduce a general formulation of KME to encompass different KME strategies. Afterward, we provide an innovative taxonomy of KME techniques based on how the new knowledge is introduced into pre-trained LLMs, and investigate existing KME strategies while analyzing key insights, advantages, and limitations of methods from each category. Moreover, representative metrics, datasets, and applications of KME are introduced accordingly.

A key challenge is to keep these models updated with latest available information, which limits the true potential of these models for the end-applications. Although, there have been numerous attempts for LLMs Knowledge Editing (KE), i.e., to edit the LLMs prior knowledge and in turn test it via Multi-hop Question Answering (MQA), yet so far these studies are primarily focused on English language. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose: Multi-hop Questioning Answering under Knowledge Editing for Arabic Language (MQA-KEAL). MQA-KEAL stores knowledge edits as structured knowledge units in the external memory. In order to solve multi-hop question, it first uses task-decomposition to decompose the question into smaller sub-problems. Later for each sub-problem, it iteratively queries the external memory and/or target LLM in order to generate the final response. In addition, we also contribute MQUAKE-AR (Arabic translation of English benchmark MQUAKE), as well as a new benchmark MQA-AEVAL for rigorous performance evaluation of MQA under KE for Arabic language. Experimentation evaluation reveals MQA-KEAL outperforms the baseline models by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

To achieve such ideal question-answering systems, locating and then editing outdated knowledge in the natural language outputs is a general target of popular knowledge editing methods. However, this target is challenging, as both identifying which tokens to edit in the reasoning steps and ensuring the coherence of the revised reasoning chain are difficult tasks. We argue that these challenges stem from the unstructured nature of natural language outputs. To address the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{Stru}$ctural $\textbf{Edit}$ing ($\textbf{StruEdit}$), an improved baseline for knowledge editing. We first prompt LLMs to produce structured outputs consisting of reasoning triplets. Then, StruEdit removes any potentially outdated knowledge and efficiently refills the structured outputs with up-to-date information in a single step. Experimental results show that StruEdit consistently delivers the highest accuracy with lowest latency compared with other knowledge editing methods.</p></details> |  |

Symbolic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and neural Large Language Models (LLMs) can both represent knowledge. KGs provide highly accurate and explicit knowledge representation, but face scalability issue; while LLMs offer expansive coverage of knowledge, but incur significant training costs and struggle with precise and reliable knowledge manipulation. To this end, we introduce OneEdit, a neural-symbolic prototype system for collaborative knowledge editing using natural language, which facilitates easy-to-use knowledge management with KG and LLM. OneEdit consists of three modules: 1) The Interpreter serves for user interaction with natural language; 2) The Controller manages editing requests from various users, leveraging the KG with rollbacks to handle knowledge conflicts and prevent toxic knowledge attacks; 3) The Editor utilizes the knowledge from the Controller to edit KG and LLM. We conduct experiments on two new datasets with KGs which demonstrate that OneEdit can achieve superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>LLM+K...</summary><p>LLM+KG@VLDB2024, code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OneEdit</p></details> |

| **[BalancEdit: Dynamically Balancing the Generality-Locality Trade-off in Multi-modal Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01343v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts change and previously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as fine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size and complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a more viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically overlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised model performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT, specifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this foundation, we propose BalancEdit, a novel method for balanced model editing that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete, localized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To our knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive results confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal trade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset will be available.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics with limited theoretical support, often leading to performance gaps comparing to direct task fine tuning. Meanwhile, although it is easy to manipulate saved task vectors with arithmetic for different purposes, such compositional flexibility demands high memory usage, especially when dealing with a huge number of tasks, limiting scalability. This work addresses these issues with a theoretically grounded framework that explains task vector arithmetic and introduces the task vector bases framework. Building upon existing task arithmetic literature, our method significantly reduces the memory cost for downstream arithmetic with little effort, while achieving competitive performance and maintaining compositional advantage, providing a practical solution for large-scale task arithmetic.

| **[AlphaEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02355v4)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit hallucinations due to incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.7% with a single line of additional code for projection solely. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jianghoucheng/AlphaEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey in LLM(-Agent) Full Stack Safety: Data, Training and Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15585v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</p></details> |  |

While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.</p></details> | NAACL2025 Tutorial |

Timely disclosure and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in T2I models are crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of generative models. We explore a novel training-free backdoor poisoning paradigm through model editing, which is recently employed for knowledge updating in large language models. Nevertheless, we reveal the potential security risks posed by model editing techniques to image generation models. In this work, we establish the principles for backdoor attacks based on model editing, and propose a relationship-driven precise backdoor poisoning method, REDEditing. Drawing on the principles of equivalent-attribute alignment and stealthy poisoning, we develop an equivalent relationship retrieval and joint-attribute transfer approach that ensures consistent backdoor image generation through concept rebinding. A knowledge isolation constraint is proposed to preserve benign generation integrity. Our method achieves an 11\% higher attack success rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Remarkably, adding just one line of code enhances output naturalness while improving backdoor stealthiness by 24\%. This work aims to heighten awareness regarding this security vulnerability in editable image generation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[When is Task Vector Provably Effective for Model Editing? A Generalization Analysis of Nonlinear Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10957v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 as an oral paper</p></details> |

As a result, they struggle with memorizing rare events and with updating their memory as facts change over time. In addition, the uninterpretable nature of parametric memory makes it challenging to prevent hallucination. Model editing and augmenting LLMs with parameters specialized for memory are only partial solutions. In this paper, we introduce MemLLM, a novel method of enhancing LLMs by integrating a structured and explicit read-and-write memory module. MemLLM tackles the aforementioned challenges by enabling dynamic interaction with the memory and improving the LLM's capabilities in using stored knowledge. Our experiments indicate that MemLLM enhances the LLM's performance and interpretability, in language modeling in general and knowledge-intensive tasks in particular. We see MemLLM as an important step towards making LLMs more grounded and factual through memory augmentation.

Unlearning methods aim at completely removing hazardous capabilities from models and make them inaccessible to adversaries. This work challenges the fundamental differences between unlearning and traditional safety post-training from an adversarial perspective. We demonstrate that existing jailbreak methods, previously reported as ineffective against unlearning, can be successful when applied carefully. Furthermore, we develop a variety of adaptive methods that recover most supposedly unlearned capabilities. For instance, we show that finetuning on 10 unrelated examples or removing specific directions in the activation space can recover most hazardous capabilities for models edited with RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method. Our findings challenge the robustness of current unlearning approaches and question their advantages over safety training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR); Best technical paper at Neurips 2024 SoLaR workshop</p></details> |
| **[Pretraining Language Models for Diachronic Linguistic Change Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05523v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential as tools for scientific discovery. This has engendered growing interest in their use in humanistic disciplines, such as historical linguistics and literary studies. These fields often construct arguments on the basis of delineations like genre, or more inflexibly, time period. Although efforts have been made to restrict inference to specific domains via fine-tuning or model editing, we posit that the only true guarantee is domain-restricted pretraining -- typically, a data- and compute-expensive proposition. We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches. We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices. We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned. We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus. Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields. Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence. We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Definitions and Distributed Reasoning: A Proof-of-Concept Mechanistic Interpretability Study via Activation Patching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02976v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the localization of knowledge representation in fine-tuned GPT-2 models using Causal Layer Attribution via Activation Patching (CLAP), a method that identifies critical neural layers responsible for correct answer generation. The model was fine-tuned on 9,958 PubMed abstracts (epilepsy: 20,595 mentions, EEG: 11,674 mentions, seizure: 13,921 mentions) using two configurations with validation loss monitoring for early stopping. CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Efficient Model Editing with Task-Localized Sparse Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02620v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic has emerged as a promising approach for editing models by representing task-specific knowledge as composable task vectors. However, existing methods rely on network linearization to derive task vectors, leading to computational bottlenecks during training and inference. Moreover, linearization alone does not ensure weight disentanglement, the key property that enables conflict-free composition of task vectors. To address this, we propose TaLoS which allows to build sparse task vectors with minimal interference without requiring explicit linearization and sharing information across tasks. We find that pre-trained models contain a subset of parameters with consistently low gradient sensitivity across tasks, and that sparsely updating only these parameters allows for promoting weight disentanglement during fine-tuning. Our experiments prove that TaLoS improves training and inference efficiency while outperforming current methods in task addition and negation. By enabling modular parameter editing, our approach fosters practical deployment of adaptable foundation models in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ICLR 2025 - https://github.com/iurada/talos-task-arithmetic</p></details> |

This process often involves fine-tuning on user data data, which may contain sensitive information. Although not recommended, it is not uncommon for users to send passwords in messages, and fine-tuning models on this could result in passwords being leaked. In this study, a Large Language Model is fine-tuned with customer support data and passwords from the RockYou password wordlist using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Out of the first 200 passwords from the list, 37 were successfully recovered. Further, causal tracing is used to identify that password information is largely located in a few layers. Lastly, Rank One Model Editing (ROME) is used to remove the password information from the model, resulting in the number of passwords recovered going from 37 to 0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Lifelong Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05759v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) acquire information from pre-training corpora, but their stored knowledge can become inaccurate or outdated over time. Model editing addresses this challenge by modifying model parameters without retraining, and prevalent approaches leverage hypernetworks to generate these parameter updates. However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches.

| **[AnyEdit: Edit Any Knowledge Encoded in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05628v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Model Editing for LLM-based Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15117v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims at selectively updating a small subset of a neural model's parameters with an interpretable strategy to achieve desired modifications. It can significantly reduce computational costs to adapt to large language models (LLMs). Given its ability to precisely target critical components within LLMs, model editing shows great potential for efficient fine-tuning applications. In this work, we investigate model editing to serve an efficient method for adapting LLMs to solve aspect-based sentiment classification. Through causal interventions, we trace and determine which neuron hidden states are essential for the prediction of the model. By performing interventions and restorations on each component of an LLM, we identify the importance of these components for aspect-based sentiment classification. Our findings reveal that a distinct set of mid-layer representations is essential for detecting the sentiment polarity of given aspect words. Leveraging these insights, we develop a model editing approach that focuses exclusively on these critical parts of the LLM, leading to a more efficient method for adapting LLMs. Our in-domain and out-of-domain experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves competitive results compared to the currently strongest methods with significantly fewer trainable parameters, highlighting a more efficient and interpretable fine-tuning strategy.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

Our research identifies significant discrepancies in normal and merged models concerning cross-lingual consistency. We employ strategies like 'each language for itself' (ELFI) and 'each language for others' (ELFO) to stress-test these models.

Existing methods mainly focus on utilizing LLMs to solve optimization problems in a prompt-based manner, which takes observational feedback as additional textual descriptions. However, due to LLM's \textbf{high sensitivity to the prompts} and \textbf{tendency to get lost in lengthy prompts}, these methods struggle to effectively utilize the {observational} feedback from each optimization step, which severely hinders the applications for real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptually simple and general {bi-level} optimization method, namely \textbf{G}eneral \textbf{S}cientific \textbf{O}ptimizers (GSO). Specifically, GSO first utilizes inner-level simulators as experimental platforms to evaluate the current solution and provide observational feedback. Then, LLMs serve as knowledgeable and versatile scientists, generating new solutions by refining potential errors from the feedback as the outer-level optimization. Finally, simulations together with the expert knowledge in LLMs are jointly updated with bi-level interactions via model editing. Extensive experiments show that GSO consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods using \textit{six} different LLM backbones on \textit{seven} different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forget Vectors at Play: Universal Input Perturbations Driving Machine Unlearning in Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16780v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning (MU), which seeks to erase the influence of specific unwanted data from already-trained models, is becoming increasingly vital in model editing, particularly to comply with evolving data regulations like the ``right to be forgotten''. Conventional approaches are predominantly model-based, typically requiring retraining or fine-tuning the model's weights to meet unlearning requirements. In this work, we approach the MU problem from a novel input perturbation-based perspective, where the model weights remain intact throughout the unlearning process. We demonstrate the existence of a proactive input-based unlearning strategy, referred to forget vector, which can be generated as an input-agnostic data perturbation and remains as effective as model-based approximate unlearning approaches. We also explore forget vector arithmetic, whereby multiple class-specific forget vectors are combined through simple operations (e.g., linear combinations) to generate new forget vectors for unseen unlearning tasks, such as forgetting arbitrary subsets across classes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the forget vector, showcasing its competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art model-based methods.

Model editing offers an efficient and effective alternative by a single update to only a key subset of model parameters. While being efficient, these methods are not perfect. Sometimes knowledge edits are unsuccessful, i.e., UnderEdit, or the edit contaminated neighboring knowledge that should remain unchanged, i.e., OverEdit. To address these limitations, we propose iterative model editing, based on our hypothesis that a single parameter update is often insufficient, to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to minimize OverEdit. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce UnderEdit up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit up to 6 percentage points across multiple model editing algorithms, LLMs, and benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review @ ACL'25</p></details> |
| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Continuous Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03279v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without the need for costly retraining. Lifelong model editing is the most challenging task that caters to the continuous editing requirements of LLMs. Prior works primarily focus on single or batch editing; nevertheless, these methods fall short in lifelong editing scenarios due to catastrophic knowledge forgetting and the degradation of model performance. Although retrieval-based methods alleviate these issues, they are impeded by slow and cumbersome processes of integrating the retrieved knowledge into the model. In this work, we introduce RECIPE, a RetriEval-augmented ContInuous Prompt lEarning method, to boost editing efficacy and inference efficiency in lifelong learning. RECIPE first converts knowledge statements into short and informative continuous prompts, prefixed to the LLM's input query embedding, to efficiently refine the response grounded on the knowledge. It further integrates the Knowledge Sentinel (KS) that acts as an intermediary to calculate a dynamic threshold, determining whether the retrieval repository contains relevant knowledge.

| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for Vision Language Models with Low-Rank Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15432v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct inaccurate knowledge, update outdated information, and incorporate new data into Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. This task poses challenges in lifelong scenarios where edits must be continuously applied for real-world applications. While some editors demonstrate strong robustness for lifelong editing in pure LLMs, Vision LLMs (VLLMs), which incorporate an additional vision modality, are not directly adaptable to existing LLM editors. In this paper, we propose LiveEdit, a LIfelong Vision language modEl Edit to bridge the gap between lifelong LLM editing and VLLMs. We begin by training an editing expert generator to independently produce low-rank experts for each editing instance, with the goal of correcting the relevant responses of the VLLM. A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge, thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally, to integrate visually relevant experts, we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation, we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios. Further experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of each module design in LiveEdit.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Accepted |
| **[Unveiling Concept Attribution in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02542v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable abilities in generating realistic and high-quality images from text prompts. However, a trained model remains largely black-box; little do we know about the roles of its components in exhibiting a concept such as objects or styles. Recent works employ causal tracing to localize knowledge-storing layers in generative models without showing how other layers contribute to the target concept. In this work, we approach diffusion models' interpretability problem from a more general perspective and pose a question: \textit{``How do model components work jointly to demonstrate knowledge?''}. To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using component attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each component (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The proposed framework, called \textbf{C}omponent \textbf{A}ttribution for \textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing (positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components that contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the previous knowledge localization work. Based on this holistic understanding of diffusion models, we introduce two fast, inference-time model editing algorithms, CAD-Erase and CAD-Amplify; in particular, CAD-Erase enables erasure and CAD-Amplify allows amplification of a generated concept by ablating the positive and negative components, respectively, while retaining knowledge of other concepts. Extensive experimental results validate the significance of both positive and negative components pinpointed by our framework, demonstrating the potential of providing a complete view of interpreting generative models.

Existing debiasing strategies, such as retraining a model with counterfactual data, representation projection, and prompting often fail to efficiently eliminate bias or directly alter the models' biased internal representations. To address these issues, we propose BiasEdit, an efficient model editing method to remove stereotypical bias from language models through lightweight networks that act as editors to generate parameter updates. BiasEdit employs a debiasing loss guiding editor networks to conduct local edits on partial parameters of a language model for debiasing while preserving the language modeling abilities during editing through a retention loss. Experiments on StereoSet and Crows-Pairs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of BiasEdit in eliminating bias compared to tangental debiasing baselines and little to no impact on the language models' general capabilities. In addition, we conduct bias tracing to probe bias in various modules and explore bias editing impacts on different components of language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TrustNLP @ NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[SPEED: Scalable, Precise, and Efficient Concept Erasure for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07392v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. However, existing methods either require costly fine-tuning or degrade image quality for non-target concepts (i.e., prior) due to inherent optimization limitations. In this paper, we introduce SPEED, a model editing-based concept erasure approach that leverages null-space constraints for scalable, precise, and efficient erasure. Specifically, SPEED incorporates Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to retain the most affected non-target concepts during erasing, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to expand prior coverage while maintaining semantic consistency, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to regularize model editing by explicitly preserving key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in prior preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully removing 100 concepts within just 5 seconds.

Just Selective Contextual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05212v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As real-world knowledge evolves, the information embedded within large language models (LLMs) can become outdated, inadequate, or erroneous. Model editing has emerged as a prominent approach for updating LLMs' knowledge with minimal computational costs and parameter changes. This approach typically identifies and adjusts specific model parameters associated with newly acquired knowledge. However, existing methods often underestimate the adverse effects that parameter modifications can have on broadly distributed knowledge. More critically, post-edit LLMs frequently struggle with multi-hop reasoning and continuous knowledge updates. Although various studies have discussed these shortcomings, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we provide an evaluation of ten model editing methods along four dimensions: reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Results confirm that all ten popular model editing methods show significant shortcomings across multiple dimensions, suggesting model editing is less promising. We then propose a straightforward method called Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR), for knowledge updating. SCR does not modify model parameters but harnesses LLM's inherent contextual reasoning capabilities utilizing the updated knowledge pieces. Under SCR, an LLM first assesses whether an incoming query falls within the scope of an external knowledge base. If it does, the relevant external knowledge texts are contextualized to enhance reasoning; otherwise, the query is answered directly. We evaluate SCR against the ten model editing methods on two counterfactual datasets with three backbone LLMs. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of contextual reasoning for knowledge updating.</p></details> |  |

While model editing has been proposed to remove or filter undesirable concepts in embedding and latent spaces, it can inadvertently damage learned manifolds, distorting concepts in close semantic proximity. We identify limitations in current model editing techniques, showing that even benign, proximal concepts may become misaligned. To address the need for safe content generation, we leverage safe embeddings and a modified diffusion process with tunable weighted summation in the latent space to generate safer images. Our method preserves global context without compromising the structural integrity of the learned manifolds. We achieve state-of-the-art results on safe image generation benchmarks and offer intuitive control over the level of model safety. We identify trade-offs between safety and censorship, which presents a necessary perspective in the development of ethical AI models. We will release our code.

| **[Perturbation-Restrained Sequential Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16821v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing is an emerging field that focuses on updating the knowledge embedded within large language models (LLMs) without extensive retraining. However, current model editing methods significantly compromise the general abilities of LLMs as the number of edits increases, and this trade-off poses a substantial challenge to the continual learning of LLMs. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze that the factor affecting the general abilities in sequential model editing lies in the condition number of the edited matrix. The condition number of a matrix represents its numerical sensitivity, and therefore can be used to indicate the extent to which the original knowledge associations stored in LLMs are perturbed after editing. Subsequently, statistical findings demonstrate that the value of this factor becomes larger as the number of edits increases, thereby exacerbating the deterioration of general abilities. To this end, a framework termed Perturbation Restraint on Upper bouNd for Editing (PRUNE) is proposed, which applies the condition number restraints in sequential editing. These restraints can lower the upper bound on perturbation to edited models, thus preserving the general abilities. Systematically, we conduct experiments employing three editing methods on three LLMs across four downstream tasks. The results show that PRUNE can preserve general abilities while maintaining the editing performance effectively in sequential model editing. The code are available at https://github.com/mjy1111/PRUNE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods are both computationally intensive and lacking in controllability and transparency, inhibiting their widespread use. Furthermore, these tuning-based methods require large-scale preference data for training and are susceptible to noisy preference data. In this paper, we introduce a tuning-free alignment alternative, ProFS (Projection Filter for Subspaces), and demonstrate its effectiveness under the use case of toxicity reduction. Grounded on theory from factor analysis, ProFS is a sample-efficient model editing approach that identifies a toxic subspace in the model parameter space and reduces model toxicity by projecting away the detected subspace. The toxic subspace is identified by extracting preference data embeddings from the language model, and removing non-toxic information from these embeddings. We show that ProFS is more sample-efficient than DPO, further showcasing greater robustness to noisy data. Finally, we attempt to connect tuning based alignment with editing, by establishing both theoretical and empirical connections between ProFS and DPO, showing that ProFS can be interpreted as a denoised version of a single DPO step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[GeoEdit: Geometric Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19953v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regular updates are essential for maintaining up-to-date knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Consequently, various model editing methods have been developed to update specific knowledge within LLMs. However, training-based approaches often struggle to effectively incorporate new knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Geometric Knowledge Editing (GeoEdit). GeoEdit utilizes the geometric relationships of parameter updates from fine-tuning to differentiate between neurons associated with new knowledge updates and those related to general knowledge perturbations. By employing a direction-aware knowledge identification method, we avoid updating neurons with directions approximately orthogonal to existing knowledge, thus preserving the model's generalization ability. For the remaining neurons, we integrate both old and new knowledge for aligned directions and apply a "forget-then-learn" editing strategy for opposite directions. Additionally, we introduce an importance-guided task vector fusion technique that filters out redundant information and provides adaptive neuron-level weighting, further enhancing model editing performance. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoEdit over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Knowledge-based model editing enables precise modifications to the weights of large language models in order to modify the information encoded within. Recent approaches have seen success in enabling recall of edited information for thousands of edits at once. However, these approaches fail to produce edits that account for associated contextual information. We present K-Edit, an effective approach to generating contextually consistent knowledge edits. By using knowledge graphs, which maintain contextual consistency when an edge is edited, we are able to generate additional \textit{contextual edits} that ensure consistency of related information in the language model. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in multi-hop question answering while maintaining the general effectiveness and scalability of model edits.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's internal reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, a unified evaluation framework remains absent. To address this gap, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of causal diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate a variety of faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that all tested faithfulness metrics often fail to surpass a random baseline. Our work underscores the need for improved metrics and more reliable interpretability methods in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 18 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Constraining Sequential Model Editing with Editing Anchor Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00035v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle with hallucinations due to false or outdated knowledge. Given the high resource demands of retraining these models, there is an increasing focus on developing model editing. However, the general abilities of LLMs across downstream tasks are prone to significant degradation during sequential editing. This paper statistically observes that the parameter matrix after editing exhibits a significant deviation compared to its previous state as the number of edits increases. This serious deviation affects the original knowledge associations within LLMs and leads to the degradation of their general abilities. To this end, a framework termed Editing Anchor Compression (EAC) is proposed to constrain the deviation of the parameter matrix during sequential editing. It compresses the editing information by selecting editing anchors that are important in encoding new relations without deviating too much from the original matrix, thereby preserving the general abilities. Experiments of applying EAC to two popular editing methods on three LLMs across four tasks are conducted. Evaluation results show that EAC effectively minimizes unreasonable deviations caused by model editing, preserving over 70% of the general abilities while better retaining the editing knowledge compared to the original counterpart methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Mirage of Model Editing: Revisiting Evaluation in the Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11177v3)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite near-perfect results in artificial evaluations, the effectiveness of model editing in real-world applications remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose to study model editing in question answering (QA) by establishing a rigorous evaluation practice to assess the effectiveness of editing methods in correcting LLMs' errors. It consists of QAEdit, a new benchmark derived from popular QA datasets, and a standardized evaluation framework. Our single editing experiments indicate that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. ~96%). Through module analysis and controlled experiments, we demonstrate that this performance decline stems from issues in evaluation practices of prior editing research. One key issue is the inappropriate use of teacher forcing in testing prevents error propagation by feeding ground truth tokens (inaccessible in real-world scenarios) as input. Furthermore, we simulate real-world deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits. Our analysis provides a fundamental reexamination of both the real-world applicability of existing model editing methods and their evaluation practices, and establishes a rigorous evaluation framework with key insights to advance reliable and practical model editing research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Updatable Large Language Models by Integrating Context into Model Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00487v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), the rapid and frequent integration of small-scale experiences, such as interactions with surrounding objects, remains a substantial challenge. Two critical factors in assimilating these experiences are (1) Efficacy: the ability to accurately remember recent events; (2) Retention: the capacity to recall long-past experiences. Current methods either embed experiences within model parameters using continual learning, model editing, or knowledge distillation techniques, which often struggle with rapid updates and complex interactions, or rely on external storage to achieve long-term retention, thereby increasing storage requirements. In this paper, we propose SELF-PARAM (Self-Updatable Large Language Models with Parameter Integration). SELF-PARAM requires no extra parameters while ensuring near-optimal efficacy and long-term retention. Our method employs a training objective that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predictions of an original model (with access to contextual information) and a target model (without such access). By generating diverse question-answer pairs related to the knowledge and minimizing the KL divergence across this dataset, we update the target model to internalize the knowledge seamlessly within its parameters. Evaluations on question-answering and conversational recommendation tasks demonstrate that SELF-PARAM significantly outperforms existing methods, even when accounting for non-zero storage requirements. This advancement paves the way for more efficient and scalable integration of experiences in large language models by embedding knowledge directly into model parameters.</p></details> |  |

While model editing methods have been developed to address such errors without full re-training, they frequently suffer from knowledge conflicts, where outdated information interferes with new knowledge. In this work, we propose Conflict-free Model Editing (CoME), a novel framework that enhances the accuracy of knowledge updates in LLMs by selectively removing outdated knowledge. CoME leverages unlearning to mitigate knowledge interference, allowing new information to be integrated without compromising relevant linguistic features. Through experiments on GPT-J and LLaMA-3 using Counterfact and ZsRE datasets, we demonstrate that CoME improves both editing accuracy and model reliability when applied to existing editing methods. Our results highlight that the targeted removal of outdated knowledge is crucial for enhancing model editing effectiveness and maintaining the model's generative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Existing defense mechanisms, such as safety fine-tuning and model editing, either require extensive parameter modifications or lack precision, leading to performance degradation on general tasks, which is unsuitable to post-deployment safety alignment. To address these challenges, we propose DELMAN (Dynamic Editing for LLMs JAilbreak DefeNse), a novel approach leveraging direct model editing for precise, dynamic protection against jailbreak attacks. DELMAN directly updates a minimal set of relevant parameters to neutralize harmful behaviors while preserving the model's utility. To avoid triggering a safe response in benign context, we incorporate KL-divergence regularization to ensure the updated model remains consistent with the original model when processing benign queries. Experimental results demonstrate that DELMAN outperforms baseline methods in mitigating jailbreak attacks while preserving the model's utility, and adapts seamlessly to new attack instances, providing a practical and efficient solution for post-deployment model protection.</p></details> |  |

Recent model editing is a promising technique for efficiently updating a small amount of knowledge of LLMs and has attracted much attention. In particular, local editing methods, which directly update model parameters, are proven suitable for updating small amounts of knowledge. Local editing methods update weights by computing least squares closed-form solutions and identify edited knowledge by vector-level matching in inference, which achieve promising results. However, these methods still require a lot of time and resources to complete the computation. Moreover, vector-level matching lacks reliability, and such updates disrupt the original organization of the model's parameters. To address these issues, we propose a detachable and expandable Subject Word Embedding Altering (SWEA) framework, which finds the editing embeddings through token-level matching and adds them to the subject word embeddings in Transformer input. To get these editing embeddings, we propose optimizing then suppressing fusion method, which first optimizes learnable embedding vectors for the editing target and then suppresses the Knowledge Embedding Dimensions (KEDs) to obtain final editing embeddings. We thus propose SWEA$\oplus$OS method for editing factual knowledge in LLMs. We demonstrate the overall state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of SWEA$\oplus$OS on the CounterFact and zsRE datasets. To further validate the reasoning ability of SWEA$\oplus$OS in editing knowledge, we evaluate it on the more complex RippleEdits benchmark.

Current approaches to address this issue involve costly dataset scrubbing, or model filtering through unlearning and model editing, which can be bypassed through extraction attacks. We propose REVS, a novel non-gradient-based method for unlearning sensitive information from LMs. REVS identifies and modifies a small subset of neurons relevant for constituent tokens that form sensitive information. To adequately evaluate our method on truly sensitive information, we curate three datasets: email and URL datasets naturally memorized by the models, and a synthetic social security number dataset that we tune the models to memorize. Compared to other methods, REVS demonstrates superior performance in unlearning sensitive information and robustness to extraction attacks, while retaining underlying model integrity.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Specifically, we investigate CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining), a prominent visual-language representation model trained on extensive image-text pairs. Building upon interpretability tools developed for single-modal models, we extend these methodologies to assess multi-modal interpretability of CLIP features. Additionally, we introduce the Modality Dominance Score (MDS) to attribute the interpretability of each feature to its respective modality. Next, we transform CLIP features into a more interpretable space, enabling us to categorize them into three distinct classes: vision features (single-modal), language features (single-modal), and visual-language features (cross-modal). Our findings reveal that this categorization aligns closely with human cognitive understandings of different modalities. We also demonstrate significant use cases of this modality-specific features including detecting gender bias, adversarial attack defense and text-to-image model editing. These results indicate that large-scale multimodal models, equipped with task-agnostic interpretability tools, offer valuable insights into key connections and distinctions between different modalities.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the problem of Large Scale Knowledge Washing, focusing on unlearning an extensive amount of factual knowledge. Previous unlearning methods usually define the reverse loss and update the model via backpropagation, which may affect the model's fluency and reasoning ability or even destroy the model due to extensive training with the reverse loss. Existing works introduce additional data from downstream tasks to prevent the model from losing capabilities, which requires downstream task awareness. Controlling the tradeoff of unlearning and maintaining existing capabilities is also challenging. To this end, we propose LAW (Large Scale Washing) to update the MLP layers in decoder-only large language models to perform knowledge washing, as inspired by model editing methods and based on the hypothesis that knowledge and reasoning are disentanglable. We derive a new objective with the knowledge to be unlearned to update the weights of certain MLP layers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LAW in forgetting target knowledge while maintaining reasoning ability.

Numerous methods have been developed to attribute model behavior to three key aspects: input features, training data, and internal model components. However, these attribution methods are studied and applied rather independently, resulting in a fragmented landscape of approaches and terminology. This position paper argues that feature, data, and component attribution methods share fundamental similarities, and bridging them can benefit interpretability research. We conduct a detailed analysis of successful methods of these three attribution aspects and present a unified view to demonstrate that these seemingly distinct methods employ similar approaches, such as perturbations, gradients, and linear approximations, differing primarily in their perspectives rather than core techniques. Our unified perspective enhances understanding of existing attribution methods, identifies shared concepts and challenges, makes this field more accessible to newcomers, and highlights new directions not only for attribution and interpretability but also for broader AI research, including model editing, steering, and regulation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TimeDiT, a diffusion transformer model that synergistically combines transformer-based temporal dependency learning with diffusion-based probabilistic sampling. TimeDiT employs a unified masking mechanism to harmonize the training and inference process across diverse tasks while introducing a theoretically grounded, finetuning-free model editing strategy that enables flexible integration of external knowledge during sampling. Acknowledging the challenges of unifying multiple downstream tasks under a single model, our systematic evaluation demonstrates TimeDiT's effectiveness both in fundamental tasks, i.e., forecasting and imputation, through zero-shot/fine-tuning; and in domain tasks, i.e., multi-resolution forecasting, anomaly detection, and data generation, establishing it as a \textit{proto-foundation model} that bridges the gap between general-purpose and domain-specific models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 11 Figures, 22 Tables.

Current approaches either provide interpretable features without the ability to test their causal influence, or enable model editing without interpretable controls. We present a unified framework using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that bridges this gap, allowing us to discover human-interpretable visual features and precisely manipulate them to test hypotheses about model behavior. By applying our method to state-of-the-art vision models, we reveal key differences in the semantic abstractions learned by models with different pre-training objectives. We then demonstrate the practical usage of our framework through controlled interventions across multiple vision tasks. We show that SAEs can reliably identify and manipulate interpretable visual features without model re-training, providing a powerful tool for understanding and controlling vision model behavior.

However, KEs can be used for malicious applications, e.g., inserting misinformation and toxic content. Knowing whether a generated output is based on edited knowledge or first-hand knowledge from pre-training can increase users' trust in generative models and provide more transparency. Driven by this, we propose a novel task: detecting edited knowledge in language models. Given an edited model and a fact retrieved by a prompt from an edited model, the objective is to classify the knowledge as either unedited (based on the pre-training), or edited (based on subsequent editing). We instantiate the task with four KEs, two LLMs, and two datasets. Additionally, we propose using the hidden state representations and the probability distributions as features for the detection. Our results reveal that, using these features as inputs to a simple AdaBoost classifiers establishes a strong baseline. This classifier requires only a limited amount of data and maintains its performance even in cross-domain settings. Last, we find it more challenging to distinguish edited knowledge from unedited but related knowledge, highlighting the need for further research. Our work lays the groundwork for addressing malicious model editing, which is a critical challenge associated with the strong generative capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</p></details> |
| **[Injecting Universal Jailbreak Backdoors into LLMs in Minutes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10438v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak backdoor attacks on LLMs have garnered attention for their effectiveness and stealth. However, existing methods rely on the crafting of poisoned datasets and the time-consuming process of fine-tuning. In this work, we propose JailbreakEdit, a novel jailbreak backdoor injection method that exploits model editing techniques to inject a universal jailbreak backdoor into safety-aligned LLMs with minimal intervention in minutes. JailbreakEdit integrates a multi-node target estimation to estimate the jailbreak space, thus creating shortcuts from the backdoor to this estimated jailbreak space that induce jailbreak actions. Our attack effectively shifts the models' attention by attaching strong semantics to the backdoor, enabling it to bypass internal safety mechanisms. Experimental results show that JailbreakEdit achieves a high jailbreak success rate on jailbreak prompts while preserving generation quality, and safe performance on normal queries. Our findings underscore the effectiveness, stealthiness, and explainability of JailbreakEdit, emphasizing the need for more advanced defense mechanisms in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning from models beyond fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08184v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FM) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks (especially in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision), primarily attributed to their ability to comprehend instructions and access extensive, high-quality data. This not only showcases their current effectiveness but also sets a promising trajectory towards the development of artificial general intelligence. Unfortunately, due to multiple constraints, the raw data of the model used for large model training are often inaccessible, so the use of end-to-end models for downstream tasks has become a new research trend, which we call Learn From Model (LFM) in this article. LFM focuses on the research, modification, and design of FM based on the model interface, so as to better understand the model structure and weights (in a black box environment), and to generalize the model to downstream tasks. The study of LFM techniques can be broadly categorized into five major areas: model tuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta learning and model editing. Each category encompasses a repertoire of methods and strategies that aim to enhance the capabilities and performance of FM. This paper gives a comprehensive review of the current methods based on FM from the perspective of LFM, in order to help readers better understand the current research status and ideas. To conclude, we summarize the survey by highlighting several critical areas for future exploration and addressing open issues that require further attention from the research community.

In this work, we investigate a Cross-Encoder variant of MiniLM to determine which relevance features it computes and where they are stored. We find that it employs a semantic variant of the traditional BM25 in an interpretable manner, featuring localized components: (1) Transformer attention heads that compute soft term frequency while controlling for term saturation and document length effects, and (2) a low-rank component of its embedding matrix that encodes inverse document frequency information for the vocabulary. This suggests that the Cross-Encoder uses the same fundamental mechanisms as BM25, but further leverages their capacity to capture semantics for improved retrieval performance. The granular understanding lays the groundwork for model editing to enhance model transparency, addressing safety concerns, and improving scalability in training and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Residual Distribution of Locate-then-Editing Methods in Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03748v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing is a powerful technique for updating the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Locate-then-edit methods are a popular class of approaches that first identify the critical layers storing knowledge, then compute the residual of the last critical layer based on the edited knowledge, and finally perform multi-layer updates using a least-squares solution by evenly distributing the residual from the first critical layer to the last. Although these methods achieve promising results, they have been shown to degrade the original knowledge of LLMs. We argue that residual distribution leads to this issue. To explore this, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of residual distribution in locate-then-edit methods from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, revealing that residual distribution introduces editing errors, leading to inaccurate edits. To address this issue, we propose the Boundary Layer UpdatE (BLUE) strategy to enhance locate-then-edit methods. Sequential batch editing experiments on three LLMs and two datasets demonstrate that BLUE not only delivers an average performance improvement of 35.59\%, significantly advancing the state of the art in model editing, but also enhances the preservation of LLMs' general capabilities.

These facts can become outdated over time, which has led to the development of knowledge editing methods (KEs) that can change specific facts in LLMs with limited side effects. This position paper argues that editing LLMs poses serious safety risks that have been largely overlooked. First, we note the fact that KEs are widely available, computationally inexpensive, highly performant, and stealthy makes them an attractive tool for malicious actors. Second, we discuss malicious use cases of KEs, showing how KEs can be easily adapted for a variety of malicious purposes. Third, we highlight vulnerabilities in the AI ecosystem that allow unrestricted uploading and downloading of updated models without verification. Fourth, we argue that a lack of social and institutional awareness exacerbates this risk, and discuss the implications for different stakeholders. We call on the community to (i) research tamper-resistant models and countermeasures against malicious model editing, and (ii) actively engage in securing the AI ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation. However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt. We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI-2025 as an oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Semantic Consistency of Large Language Models through Model Editing: An Interpretability-Oriented Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11041v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Large Language Model (LLM) tends to generate inconsistent and sometimes contradictory outputs when presented with a prompt that has equivalent semantics but is expressed differently from the original prompt. To achieve semantic consistency of an LLM, one of the key approaches is to finetune the model with prompt-output pairs with semantically equivalent meanings. Despite its effectiveness, a data-driven finetuning method incurs substantial computation costs in data preparation and model optimization. In this regime, an LLM is treated as a ``black box'', restricting our ability to gain deeper insights into its internal mechanism. In this paper, we are motivated to enhance the semantic consistency of LLMs through a more interpretable method (i.e., model editing) to this end. We first identify the model components (i.e., attention heads) that have a key impact on the semantic consistency of an LLM. We subsequently inject biases into the output of these model components along the semantic-consistency activation direction. It is noteworthy that these modifications are cost-effective, without reliance on mass manipulations of the original model parameters. Through comprehensive experiments on the constructed NLU and open-source NLG datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvements in the semantic consistency and task performance of LLMs. Additionally, our method exhibits promising generalization capabilities by performing well on tasks beyond the primary tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELDER: Enhancing Lifelong Model Editing with Mixture-of-LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11869v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) require model editing to efficiently update specific knowledge within them and avoid factual errors. Most model editing methods are solely designed for single-time use and result in a significant forgetting effect in lifelong editing scenarios, where sequential edits are conducted over time. Previous approaches manage sequential edits by freezing original parameters and discretely allocating new parameters for each knowledge update. However, these methods lack robustness to minor input variations due to the discrete mapping between data and parameters. To overcome this challenge, we propose ELDER, a novel approach to create a continuous association between data and adapters. ELDER integrates multiple LoRAs through a router network and is trained to establish a smooth data-adapter association, thereby enhancing the edit robustness and generalization of semantically equivalent inputs. To ensure inputs containing the same knowledge will be processed by the same LoRAs, we design a novel loss to guide the model link LoRA allocations with edit knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a deferral mechanism to retain the original LLM capabilities post-edit. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 XL and LLaMA2-7B demonstrate that ELDER effectively edits models in the lifelong setting, outperforming eight baselines while exhibiting strong scalability and preserving LLMs' general abilities on downstream tasks.

| **[WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14768v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

| **[Concept-ROT: Poisoning Concepts in Large Language Models with Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13341v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing methods modify specific behaviors of Large Language Models by altering a small, targeted set of network weights and require very little data and compute. These methods can be used for malicious applications such as inserting misinformation or simple trojans that result in adversary-specified behaviors when a trigger word is present. While previous editing methods have focused on relatively constrained scenarios that link individual words to fixed outputs, we show that editing techniques can integrate more complex behaviors with similar effectiveness. We develop Concept-ROT, a model editing-based method that efficiently inserts trojans which not only exhibit complex output behaviors, but also trigger on high-level concepts -- presenting an entirely new class of trojan attacks. Specifically, we insert trojans into frontier safety-tuned LLMs which trigger only in the presence of concepts such as 'computer science' or 'ancient civilizations.' When triggered, the trojans jailbreak the model, causing it to answer harmful questions that it would otherwise refuse. Our results further motivate concerns over the practicality and potential ramifications of trojan attacks on Machine Learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Can Knowledge Edit Methods Edit Perplexing Knowledge?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17253v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but updating their knowledge post-training remains a critical challenge. While recent model editing techniques like Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) show promise, their effectiveness may vary based on the nature of the knowledge being edited. We introduce the concept of ``perplexingness'': the degree to which new knowledge conflicts with an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies and categorical relationships. For instance, editing ``British Shorthair is a kind of cat'' to ``British Shorthair is a kind of dog'' represents a low-perplexingness edit within the same taxonomic level, while editing ``A cat is a kind of animal'' to ``A cat is a kind of plant'' represents a high-perplexingness edit that violates fundamental categorical boundaries. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we introduce HierarchyData, a carefully curated dataset of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories. Through controlled experiments across three models and four editing methods, we demonstrate a strong negative correlation between the perplexingness of new knowledge and the effectiveness of knowledge editing. Our analysis reveals that edits involving more abstract concepts (hypernyms) generally exhibit higher perplexingness and are more resistant to modification than their specific counterparts (hyponyms). These findings highlight a fundamental challenge in LLM knowledge editing: the more a new fact contradicts an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies, the harder it becomes to reliably encode that knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Editing-Based Jailbreak against Safety-aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08201v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields by enabling advanced natural language interactions but remain susceptible to critical vulnerabilities, particularly jailbreak attacks. Current jailbreak techniques, while effective, often depend on input modifications, making them detectable and limiting their stealth and scalability. This paper presents Targeted Model Editing (TME), a novel white-box approach that bypasses safety filters by minimally altering internal model structures while preserving the model's intended functionalities. TME identifies and removes safety-critical transformations (SCTs) embedded in model matrices, enabling malicious queries to bypass restrictions without input modifications. By analyzing distinct activation patterns between safe and unsafe queries, TME isolates and approximates SCTs through an optimization process. Implemented in the D-LLM framework, our method achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.86% on four mainstream open-source LLMs, maintaining high performance. Unlike existing methods, D-LLM eliminates the need for specific triggers or harmful response collections, offering a stealthier and more effective jailbreak strategy. This work reveals a covert and robust threat vector in LLM security and emphasizes the need for stronger safeguards in model safety alignment.</p></details> |  |

This initiative aims to eliminate undesirable data influence (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) and the associated model capabilities, while maintaining the integrity of essential knowledge generation and not affecting causally unrelated information. We envision LLM unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of LLMs, potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing generative AI that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining. We navigate the unlearning landscape in LLMs from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications. In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing LLM unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment. We also draw connections between LLM unlearning and related areas such as model editing, influence functions, model explanation, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we outline an effective assessment framework for LLM unlearning and explore its applications in copyright and privacy safeguards and sociotechnical harm reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

These scoping mechanisms utilize distance functions in the representation space to ascertain the scope of the edit. In this work, we show that distance-based scoping functions grapple with lexical biases leading to issues such as misfires with irrelevant prompts that share similar lexical characteristics. To address this problem, we introduce, Projector Editor Networks for Model Editing (PENME),is a model editing approach that employs a compact adapter with a projection network trained via a contrastive learning objective. We demonstrate the efficacy of PENME in achieving superior results while being compute efficient and flexible to adapt across model architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Editing for LLMs4Code: How Far are We?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06638v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code) have been found to exhibit outstanding performance in the software engineering domain, especially the remarkable performance in coding tasks. However, even the most advanced LLMs4Code can inevitably contain incorrect or outdated code knowledge. Due to the high cost of training LLMs4Code, it is impractical to re-train the models for fixing these problematic code knowledge. Model editing is a new technical field for effectively and efficiently correcting erroneous knowledge in LLMs, where various model editing techniques and benchmarks have been proposed recently. Despite that, a comprehensive study that thoroughly compares and analyzes the performance of the state-of-the-art model editing techniques for adapting the knowledge within LLMs4Code across various code-related tasks is notably absent. To bridge this gap, we perform the first systematic study on applying state-of-the-art model editing approaches to repair the inaccuracy of LLMs4Code. To that end, we introduce a benchmark named CLMEEval, which consists of two datasets, i.e., CoNaLa-Edit (CNLE) with 21K+ code generation samples and CodeSearchNet-Edit (CSNE) with 16K+ code summarization samples. With the help of CLMEEval, we evaluate six advanced model editing techniques on three LLMs4Code: CodeLlama (7B), CodeQwen1.5 (7B), and Stable-Code (3B). Our findings include that the external memorization-based GRACE approach achieves the best knowledge editing effectiveness and specificity (the editing does not influence untargeted knowledge), while generalization (whether the editing can generalize to other semantically-identical inputs) is a universal challenge for existing techniques. Furthermore, building on in-depth case analysis, we introduce an enhanced version of GRACE called A-GRACE, which incorporates contrastive learning to better capture the semantics of the inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE2025.

Unveiling the vulnerabilities of safety guardrails to harmful queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15302v5)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we tackle a growing concern around the safety and ethical use of large language models (LLMs). Despite their potential, these models can be tricked into producing harmful or unethical content through various sophisticated methods, including 'jailbreaking' techniques and targeted manipulation. Our work zeroes in on a specific issue: to what extent LLMs can be led astray by asking them to generate responses that are instruction-centric such as a pseudocode, a program or a software snippet as opposed to vanilla text. To investigate this question, we introduce TechHazardQA, a dataset containing complex queries which should be answered in both text and instruction-centric formats (e.g., pseudocodes), aimed at identifying triggers for unethical responses. We query a series of LLMs -- Llama-2-13b, Llama-2-7b, Mistral-V2 and Mistral 8X7B -- and ask them to generate both text and instruction-centric responses. For evaluation we report the harmfulness score metric as well as judgements from GPT-4 and humans. Overall, we observe that asking LLMs to produce instruction-centric responses enhances the unethical response generation by ~2-38% across the models. As an additional objective, we investigate the impact of model editing using the ROME technique, which further increases the propensity for generating undesirable content. In particular, asking edited LLMs to generate instruction-centric responses further increases the unethical response generation by ~3-16% across the different models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2025.

However, these high-dimensional, dense vector representations are not easily interpretable, limiting our understanding of the rich structure of CLIP and its use in downstream applications that require transparency. In this work, we show that the semantic structure of CLIP's latent space can be leveraged to provide interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of representations into semantic concepts. We formulate this problem as one of sparse recovery and propose a novel method, Sparse Linear Concept Embeddings, for transforming CLIP representations into sparse linear combinations of human-interpretable concepts. Distinct from previous work, SpLiCE is task-agnostic and can be used, without training, to explain and even replace traditional dense CLIP representations, maintaining high downstream performance while significantly improving their interpretability.

While significant progress has been made in editing Transformer-based large language models, effective strategies for editing vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision remain largely untapped. In this paper, we take initial steps towards correcting predictive errors of ViTs, particularly those arising from subpopulation shifts. Taking a locate-then-edit approach, we first address the where-to-edit challenge by meta-learning a hypernetwork on CutMix-augmented data generated for editing reliability. This trained hypernetwork produces generalizable binary masks that identify a sparse subset of structured model parameters, responsive to real-world failure samples. Afterward, we solve the how-to-edit problem by simply fine-tuning the identified parameters using a variant of gradient descent to achieve successful edits. To validate our method, we construct an editing benchmark that introduces subpopulation shifts towards natural underrepresented images and AI-generated images, thereby revealing the limitations of pre-trained ViTs for object recognition. Our approach not only achieves superior performance on the proposed benchmark but also allows for adjustable trade-offs between generalization and locality.

Recent research has attempted to interpret their behaviors through the lens of inner representation. However, developing practical and efficient methods for applying these representations for general and flexible model editing remains challenging. In this work, we explore how to leverage insights from representation engineering to guide the editing of LLMs by deploying a representation sensor as an editing oracle. We first identify the importance of a robust and reliable sensor during editing, then propose an Adversarial Representation Engineering (ARE) framework to provide a unified and interpretable approach for conceptual model editing without compromising baseline performance.

Our theoretical insights show that a single metric (a measure of the intrinsic dimension of the model's features) can be used to assess a model's editability and reveals its previously unrecognised susceptibility to malicious stealth attacks. This metric is fundamental to predicting the success of a variety of editing approaches, and reveals new bridges between disparate families of editing methods. We collectively refer to these as stealth editing methods, because they directly update a model's weights to specify its response to specific known hallucinating prompts without affecting other model behaviour. By carefully applying our theoretical insights, we are able to introduce a new jet-pack network block which is optimised for highly selective model editing, uses only standard network operations, and can be inserted into existing networks. We also reveal the vulnerability of language models to stealth attacks: a small change to a model's weights which fixes its response to a single attacker-chosen prompt. Stealth attacks are computationally simple, do not require access to or knowledge of the model's training data, and therefore represent a potent yet previously unrecognised threat to redistributed foundation models. Extensive experimental results illustrate and support our methods and their theoretical underpinnings.

However, recent research shows that a type of adversarial attack ($\textit{i.e.,}$ backdoor attack) can manipulate the behavior of machine learning models through contaminating their training dataset, posing significant threat in the real-world application of large pre-trained model, especially for those customized models. Therefore, addressing the unique challenges for exploring vulnerability of pre-trained models is of paramount importance. Through empirical studies on the capability for performing backdoor attack in large pre-trained models ($\textit{e.g.,}$ ViT), we find the following unique challenges of attacking large pre-trained models: 1) the inability to manipulate or even access large training datasets, and 2) the substantial computational resources required for training or fine-tuning these models. To address these challenges, we establish new standards for an effective and feasible backdoor attack in the context of large pre-trained models. In line with these standards, we introduce our EDT model, an \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{D}ata-free, \textbf{T}raining-free backdoor attack method. Inspired by model editing techniques, EDT injects an editing-based lightweight codebook into the backdoor of large pre-trained models, which replaces the embedding of the poisoned image with the target image without poisoning the training dataset or training the victim model. Our experiments, conducted across various pre-trained models such as ViT, CLIP, BLIP, and stable diffusion, and on downstream tasks including image classification, image captioning, and image generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Model editing enables the manipulation of specific knowledge memories and the behavior of language generation without retraining. However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question. This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, facilitating practical applications of communicative AI. We focus on three key research questions. RQ1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? RQ2: To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? RQ3: Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing? Our empirical studies uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs. On rephrased prompts that are flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline.

| **[Expose Before You Defend: Unifying and Enhancing Backdoor Defenses via Exposed Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19427v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks covertly implant triggers into deep neural networks (DNNs) by poisoning a small portion of the training data with pre-designed backdoor triggers. This vulnerability is exacerbated in the era of large models, where extensive (pre-)training on web-crawled datasets is susceptible to compromise. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-step defense framework named Expose Before You Defend (EBYD). EBYD unifies existing backdoor defense methods into a comprehensive defense system with enhanced performance. Specifically, EBYD first exposes the backdoor functionality in the backdoored model through a model preprocessing step called backdoor exposure, and then applies detection and removal methods to the exposed model to identify and eliminate the backdoor features. In the first step of backdoor exposure, we propose a novel technique called Clean Unlearning (CUL), which proactively unlearns clean features from the backdoored model to reveal the hidden backdoor features. We also explore various model editing/modification techniques for backdoor exposure, including fine-tuning, model sparsification, and weight perturbation. Using EBYD, we conduct extensive experiments on 10 image attacks and 6 text attacks across 2 vision datasets (CIFAR-10 and an ImageNet subset) and 4 language datasets (SST-2, IMDB, Twitter, and AG's News). The results demonstrate the importance of backdoor exposure for backdoor defense, showing that the exposed models can significantly benefit a range of downstream defense tasks, including backdoor label detection, backdoor trigger recovery, backdoor model detection, and backdoor removal. We hope our work could inspire more research in developing advanced defense frameworks with exposed models.

Existing training-time alignment methods require full re-training when a change is needed and inference-time ones typically require access to the reward model at each inference step. To address these limitations, we introduce inference-time model alignment method that learns encoded representations of preference dimensions, called \textit{Alignment Vectors} (AV). These representations are computed by subtraction of the base model from the aligned model as in model editing enabling dynamically adjusting the model behavior during inference through simple linear operations. Even though the preference dimensions can span various granularity levels, here we focus on three gradual response levels across three specialized domains: medical, legal, and financial, exemplifying its practical potential. This new alignment paradigm introduces adjustable preference knobs during inference, allowing users to tailor their LLM outputs while reducing the inference cost by half compared to the prompt engineering approach. Additionally, we find that AVs are transferable across different fine-tuning stages of the same model, demonstrating their flexibility. AVs also facilitate multidomain, diverse preference alignment, making the process 12x faster than the retraining approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Should We Really Edit Language Models? On the Evaluation of Edited Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18785v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing has become an increasingly popular alternative for efficiently updating knowledge within language models. Current methods mainly focus on reliability, generalization, and locality, with many methods excelling across these criteria. Some recent works disclose the pitfalls of these editing methods such as knowledge distortion or conflict. However, the general abilities of post-edited language models remain unexplored. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on various editing methods and different language models, and have following findings. (1) Existing editing methods lead to inevitable performance deterioration on general benchmarks, indicating that existing editing methods maintain the general abilities of the model within only a few dozen edits. When the number of edits is slightly large, the intrinsic knowledge structure of the model is disrupted or even completely damaged. (2) Instruction-tuned models are more robust to editing, showing less performance drop on general knowledge after editing. (3) Language model with large scale is more resistant to editing compared to small model. (4) The safety of the edited model, is significantly weakened, even for those safety-aligned models. Our findings indicate that current editing methods are only suitable for small-scale knowledge updates within language models, which motivates further research on more practical and reliable editing methods.

Nevertheless, outdated knowledge or factual errors within LLMs can lead to misleading or incorrect responses, causing significant issues in practical applications. To rectify the fatal flaw without the necessity for costly model retraining, various model editing approaches have been proposed to correct inaccurate knowledge within LLMs in a cost-efficient way. To evaluate these model editing methods, previous work introduced a series of datasets. However, most of the previous datasets only contain fabricated data in a single format, which diverges from real-world model editing scenarios, raising doubts about their usability in practice. To facilitate the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the challenge of practicality. To resolve such challenges and effectively enhance the capabilities of LLMs, we present FAME, an factual, comprehensive, and multi-task dataset, which is designed to enhance the practicality of model editing. We then propose SKEME, a model editing method that uses a novel caching mechanism to ensure synchronization with the real world. The experiments demonstrate that SKEME performs excellently across various tasks and scenarios, confirming its practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures.

However, editing these models, crucial for rectifying outdated or erroneous information, often leads to a complex issue known as the ripple effect in the hidden space. While difficult to detect, this effect can significantly impede the efficacy of model editing tasks and deteriorate model performance. This paper addresses this scientific challenge by proposing a novel evaluation methodology, Graphical Impact Evaluation(GIE), which quantitatively evaluates the adaptations of the model and the subsequent impact of editing. Furthermore, we introduce the Selective Impact Revision(SIR), a model editing method designed to mitigate this ripple effect. Our comprehensive evaluations reveal that the ripple effect in the hidden space is a significant issue in all current model editing methods. However, our proposed methods, GIE and SIR, effectively identify and alleviate this issue, contributing to the advancement of LLM editing techniques.</p></details> |  |

The resulting proliferation of LoRAs presents exciting opportunities for applying machine learning techniques that take these low-rank weights themselves as inputs. In this paper, we investigate the potential of Learning on LoRAs (LoL), a paradigm where LoRA weights serve as input to machine learning models. For instance, an LoL model that takes in LoRA weights as inputs could predict the performance of the finetuned model on downstream tasks, detect potentially harmful finetunes, or even generate novel model edits without traditional training methods. We first identify the inherent parameter symmetries of low rank decompositions of weights, which differ significantly from the parameter symmetries of standard neural networks. To efficiently process LoRA weights, we develop several symmetry-aware invariant or equivariant LoL models, using tools such as canonicalization, invariant featurization, and equivariant layers. We finetune thousands of text-to-image diffusion models and language models to collect datasets of LoRAs. In numerical experiments on these datasets, we show that our LoL architectures are capable of processing low rank weight decompositions to predict CLIP score, finetuning data attributes, finetuning data membership, and accuracy on downstream tasks.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Untying the Reversal Curse via Bidirectional Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10322v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) store massive factual knowledge within their parameters. But existing LLMs are prone to hallucinate unintended text due to false or outdated knowledge. Since retraining LLMs is resource intensive, there has been a growing interest in the concept of model editing. Despite the emergence of benchmarks and approaches, these unidirectional editing and evaluation have failed to explore the reversal curse. Intuitively, if "The capital of France is" is edited to be a counterfact "London" within a model, then it should be able to naturally reason and recall the reverse fact, i.e., "London is the capital of" followed by "France" instead of "England". In this paper, we study bidirectional language model editing, aiming to provide rigorous model editing evaluation to assess if edited LLMs can recall the editing knowledge bidirectionally. A new evaluation metric of reversibility is introduced, and a benchmark dubbed as Bidirectional Assessment for Knowledge Editing (BAKE) is constructed to evaluate the reversibility of edited models in recalling knowledge in the reverse direction of editing. We surprisingly observe that while current editing methods and LLMs can effectively recall editing facts in the direction of editing, they suffer serious deficiencies when evaluated in the reverse direction. To mitigate the reversal curse, a method named Bidirectionally Inversible Relationship moDeling (BIRD) is proposed. A set of editing objectives that incorporate bidirectional relationships between subject and object into the updated model weights are designed. Experiments show that BIRD improves the performance of four representative LLMs of different sizes via question answering and judgement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consecutive Batch Model Editing with HooK Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05330v3)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the typical retraining paradigm is unacceptably time- and resource-consuming, researchers are turning to model editing to find an effective way that supports both consecutive and batch scenarios to edit the model behavior directly. Despite all these practical expectations, existing model editing methods fail to realize all of them. Furthermore, the memory demands for such sequential model editing approaches tend to be prohibitive, frequently necessitating an external memory that grows incrementally over time. To cope with these challenges, we propose CoachHooK, a model editing method that simultaneously supports sequential and batch editing. CoachHooK is memory-friendly as it only needs a small amount of it to store several hook layers whose size remains unchanged over time. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over other batch-supportive model editing methods under both single-round and consecutive batch editing scenarios. Extensive analyses of CoachHooK have been conducted to verify the stability of our method over a number of consecutive steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in EMNLP 2024 Main</p></details> |

However, since most of the training samples for LLMs are unscreened, it is inevitable that LLMs' performance may not align with real-world scenarios, leading to the presence of social bias. To evaluate and quantify the gender bias in code LLMs, we propose a dataset named CodeGenBias (Gender Bias in the Code Generation) and an evaluation metric called FB-Score (Factual Bias Score) based on the actual gender distribution of correlative professions. With the help of CodeGenBias and FB-Score, we evaluate and analyze the gender bias in eight mainstream Code LLMs. Previous work has demonstrated that model editing methods that perform well in knowledge editing have the potential to mitigate social bias in LLMs. Therefore, we develop a model editing approach named MG-Editing (Multi-Granularity model Editing), which includes the locating and editing phases. Our model editing method MG-Editing can be applied at five different levels of model parameter granularity: full parameters level, layer level, module level, row level, and neuron level. Extensive experiments not only demonstrate that our MG-Editing can effectively mitigate the gender bias in code LLMs while maintaining their general code generation capabilities, but also showcase its excellent generalization. At the same time, the experimental results show that, considering both the gender bias of the model and its general code generation capability, MG-Editing is most effective when applied at the row and neuron levels of granularity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Overfitting in Large Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07819v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has been proposed as an effective method for updating and correcting the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing editing methods often struggle with complex tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we identify and investigate the phenomenon of Editing Overfit, where edited models assign disproportionately high probabilities to the edit target, hindering the generalization of new knowledge in complex scenarios. We attribute this issue to the current editing paradigm, which places excessive emphasis on the direct correspondence between the input prompt and the edit target for each edit sample. To further explore this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, EVOKE (EValuation of Editing Overfit in Knowledge Editing), along with fine-grained evaluation metrics. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Editing Overfit is prevalent in current editing methods and that common overfitting mitigation strategies are of limited effectiveness in knowledge editing. To overcome this, inspired by LLMs' knowledge recall mechanisms, we propose a new plug-and-play strategy called Learn to Inference (LTI), which introduce a Multi-stage Inference Constraint module to guide the edited models in recalling new knowledge similarly to how unedited LLMs leverage knowledge through in-context learning. Extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks validate the effectiveness of LTI in mitigating Editing Overfit.</p></details> |  |

In the work, we focus on utilizing LLMs to perform machine translation, where we observe that two patterns of errors frequently occur and drastically affect the translation quality: language mismatch and repetition. The work sets out to explore the potential for mitigating these two issues by leveraging model editing methods, e.g., by locating Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons or something that are responsible for the errors and deactivating them in the inference time. We find that directly applying such methods either limited effect on the targeted errors or has significant negative side-effect on the general translation quality, indicating that the located components may also be crucial for ensuring machine translation with LLMs on the rails. To this end, we propose to refine the located components by fetching the intersection of the locating results under different language settings, filtering out the aforementioned information that is irrelevant to targeted errors. The experiment results empirically demonstrate that our methods can effectively reduce the language mismatch and repetition ratios and meanwhile enhance or keep the general translation quality in most cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, EMNLP'2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

Such edits have previously been called disabling edits. These disabling edits cause immediate model collapse and limits the use of ROME for sequential editing. In this paper, we show that disabling edits are an artifact of irregularities in the implementation of ROME. With this paper, we provide a more stable implementation ROME, which we call r-ROME and show that model collapse is no longer observed when making large scale sequential edits with r-ROME, while further improving generalization and locality of model editing compared to the original implementation of ROME. We also provide a detailed mathematical explanation of the reason behind disabling edits.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 (Main) |

In this paper, we unify these two algorithms under a single conceptual umbrella, optimizing for the same goal, which we call the preservation-memorization objective. ROME uses an equality constraint to optimize this objective to perform one edit at a time, whereas MEMIT employs a more flexible least-square constraint that allows for batched edits. We generalize ROME and enable batched editing with equality constraint in the form of EMMET - an Equality-constrained Mass Model Editing algorithm for Transformers, a new batched memory-editing algorithm. EMMET can perform batched-edits up to a batch-size of 10,000, with very similar performance to MEMIT across multiple dimensions. With the introduction of EMMET, we truly unify ROME and MEMIT and show that both algorithms are equivalent in terms of their optimization objective, their abilities (singular and batched editing), their model editing performance and their limitations.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

Yet, compared to text-to-image (T2I) editing, text-to-video (T2V) editing suffers from a lack of decent temporal consistency and structure, due to insufficient pre-training data, limited model editability, or extensive tuning costs. To address this gap, we propose FLDM (Fused Latent Diffusion Model), a training-free framework that achieves high-quality T2V editing by integrating various T2I and T2V LDMs. Specifically, FLDM utilizes a hyper-parameter with an update schedule to effectively fuse image and video latents during the denoising process. This paper is the first to reveal that T2I and T2V LDMs can complement each other in terms of structure and temporal consistency, ultimately generating high-quality videos. It is worth noting that FLDM can serve as a versatile plugin, applicable to off-the-shelf image and video LDMs, to significantly enhance the quality of video editing. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on popular T2I and T2V LDMs demonstrate FLDM's superior editing quality than state-of-the-art T2V editing methods.

| **[Neuron-Level Sequential Editing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04045v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores sequential model editing in large language models (LLMs), a critical task that involves modifying internal knowledge within LLMs continuously through multi-round editing, each incorporating updates or corrections to adjust the model outputs without the need for costly retraining. Existing model editing methods, especially those that alter model parameters, typically focus on single-round editing and often face significant challenges in sequential model editing-most notably issues of model forgetting and failure. To address these challenges, we introduce a new model editing method, namely \textbf{N}euron-level \textbf{S}equential \textbf{E}diting (NSE), tailored for supporting sequential model editing. Specifically, we optimize the target layer's hidden states using the model's original weights to prevent model failure. Furthermore, we iteratively select neurons in multiple layers for editing based on their activation values to mitigate model forgetting. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that NSE significantly outperforms current modifying parameters model editing methods, marking a substantial advancement in the field of sequential model editing. Our code is released on \url{https://github.com/jianghoucheng/NSE}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Editing Harms General Abilities of Large Language Models: Regularization to the Rescue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04700v4)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing is a technique that edits the large language models (LLMs) with updated knowledge to alleviate hallucinations without resource-intensive retraining. While current model editing methods can effectively modify a model's behavior within a specific area of interest, they often overlook the potential unintended side effects on the general abilities of LLMs such as reasoning, natural language inference, and question answering. In this paper, we raise concerns that model editing's improvements on factuality may come at the cost of a significant degradation of the model's general abilities. We systematically analyze the side effects by evaluating four popular editing methods on three LLMs across eight representative tasks. Our extensive empirical experiments show that it is challenging for current editing methods to simultaneously improve factuality of LLMs and maintain their general abilities. Our analysis reveals that the side effects are caused by model editing altering the original model weights excessively, leading to overfitting to the edited facts. To mitigate this, a method named RECT is proposed to regularize the edit update weights by imposing constraints on their complexity based on the RElative Change in weighT. Evaluation results show that RECT can significantly mitigate the side effects of editing while still maintaining over 94% editing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

DPR fine-tunes pre-trained networks to enhance the alignment of the embeddings between queries and relevant textual data. A deeper understanding of DPR fine-tuning will be required to fundamentally unlock the full potential of this approach. In this work, we explore DPR-trained models mechanistically by using a combination of probing, layer activation analysis, and model editing. Our experiments show that DPR training decentralizes how knowledge is stored in the network, creating multiple access pathways to the same information. We also uncover a limitation in this training style: the internal knowledge of the pre-trained model bounds what the retrieval model can retrieve. These findings suggest a few possible directions for dense retrieval: (1) expose the DPR training process to more knowledge so more can be decentralized, (2) inject facts as decentralized representations, (3) model and incorporate knowledge uncertainty in the retrieval process, and (4) directly map internal model knowledge to a knowledge base.</p></details> |  |

However, model editing can have unintended consequences after edits are applied: information unrelated to the edits can also be changed, and other general behaviors of the model can be wrongly altered. In this work, we investigate how model editing methods unexpectedly amplify model biases post-edit. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Seesaw-CF, for measuring bias-related harms of model editing and conduct the first in-depth investigation of how different weight-editing methods impact model bias. Specifically, we focus on biases with respect to demographic attributes such as race, geographic origin, and gender, as well as qualitative flaws in long-form texts generated by edited language models. We find that edited models exhibit, to various degrees, more biased behavior as they become less confident in attributes for Asian, African, and South American subjects. Furthermore, edited models amplify sexism and xenophobia in text generations while remaining seemingly coherent and logical. Finally, editing facts about place of birth, country of citizenship, or gender have particularly negative effects on the model's knowledge about unrelated features like field of work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main. 9 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Better Call SAUL: Fluent and Consistent Language Model Editing with Generation Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02433v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure large language models contain up-to-date knowledge, they need to be updated regularly. However, model editing is challenging as it might also affect knowledge that is unrelated to the new data. State-of-the-art methods identify parameters associated with specific knowledge and then modify them via direct weight updates. However, these locate-and-edit methods suffer from heavy computational overhead and lack theoretical validation. In contrast, directly fine-tuning the model on requested edits affects the model's behavior on unrelated knowledge, and significantly damages the model's generation fluency and consistency. To address these challenges, we propose SAUL, a streamlined model editing method that uses sentence concatenation with augmented random facts for generation regularization. Evaluations on three model editing benchmarks show that SAUL is a practical and reliable solution for model editing outperforming state-of-the-art methods while maintaining generation quality and reducing computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Recent research in it model editing has highlighted the challenges in balancing generalization and locality, especially in the context of lifelong model editing. We discover that inserting knowledge directly into the model often causes conflicts and potentially disrupts other unrelated pre-trained knowledge. To address this problem, we introduce UniAdapt, a universal adapter for knowledge calibration. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts architecture and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, UniAdapt is designed with a vector-assisted router that is responsible for routing inputs to appropriate experts. The router maintains a vector store, including multiple shards, to construct routing vectors based on semantic similarity search results. UniAdapt is fully model-agnostic and designed for seamless plug-and-play integration. Experimental results show that UniAdapt outperforms existing lifelong model editors and achieves exceptional results in most metrics.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel backdoor mitigation approach via machine unlearning to counter such backdoor attacks. The proposed method utilizes model activation of domain-equivalent unseen data to guide the editing of the model's weights. Unlike the previous unlearning-based mitigation methods, ours is computationally inexpensive and achieves state-of-the-art performance while only requiring a handful of unseen samples for unlearning. In addition, we also point out that unlearning the backdoor may cause the whole targeted class to be unlearned, thus introducing an additional repair step to preserve the model's utility after editing the model. Experiment results show that the proposed method is effective in unlearning the backdoor on different datasets and trigger patterns.</p></details> |  |

Among them, ROME is particularly concerning, as it could disrupt LLMs with only a single edit. In this paper, we study the root causes of such collapse. Through extensive analysis, we identify two primary factors that contribute to the collapse: i) inconsistent handling of prefixed and unprefixed keys in the parameter update equation may result in very small denominators, causing excessively large parameter updates; ii) the subject of collapse cases is usually the first token, whose unprefixed key distribution significantly differs from the prefixed key distribution in autoregressive transformers, causing the aforementioned issue to materialize. To validate our findings, we propose a simple yet effective approach: uniformly using prefixed keys during editing phase and adding prefixes during testing phase to ensure the consistency between training and testing. The experimental results show that the proposed solution can prevent model collapse while maintaining the effectiveness of the edits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2024 (Camera-Ready Version)</p></details> |

To maintain relevance and accuracy of LLMs, model editing has emerged as a pivotal research area. While these methods hold promise, they can also produce unintended side effects. Their underlying factors and causes remain largely unexplored. This paper delves into a critical factor-question type-by categorizing model editing questions. Our findings reveal that the extent of performance degradation varies significantly across different question types, providing new insights for experimental design in knowledge editing. Furthermore, we investigate whether insights from smaller models can be extrapolated to larger models. Our results indicate discrepancies in findings between models of different sizes, suggesting that insights from smaller models may not necessarily apply to larger models. Additionally, we examine the impact of batch size on side effects, discovering that increasing the batch size can mitigate performance drops.</p></details> |  |
| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v3)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics.

To delve into the reason, we introduce the Comparative Neuron Analysis (CNA) method, which identifies an internal logic chain consisting of four distinct stages from input to prediction: feature enhancing with shallow FFN neurons, feature transferring by shallow attention layers, feature predicting by arithmetic heads, and prediction enhancing among deep FFN neurons. Moreover, we identify the human-interpretable FFN neurons within both feature-enhancing and feature-predicting stages. These findings lead us to investigate the mechanism of LoRA, revealing that it enhances prediction probabilities by amplifying the coefficient scores of FFN neurons related to predictions. Finally, we apply our method in model pruning for arithmetic tasks and model editing for reducing gender bias.

| **[Property Neurons in Self-Supervised Speech Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05910v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There have been many studies on analyzing self-supervised speech Transformers, in particular, with layer-wise analysis. It is, however, desirable to have an approach that can pinpoint exactly a subset of neurons that is responsible for a particular property of speech, being amenable to model pruning and model editing. In this work, we identify a set of property neurons in the feedforward layers of Transformers to study how speech-related properties, such as phones, gender, and pitch, are stored. When removing neurons of a particular property (a simple form of model editing), the respective downstream performance significantly degrades, showing the importance of the property neurons. We apply this approach to pruning the feedforward layers in Transformers, where most of the model parameters are. We show that protecting property neurons during pruning is significantly more effective than norm-based pruning. The code for identifying property neurons is available at https://github.com/nervjack2/PropertyNeurons.</p></details> | Accepted by SLT 2024 |
| **[Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16218v4)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently transformed both the academic and industrial landscapes due to their remarkable capacity to understand, analyze, and generate texts based on their vast knowledge and reasoning ability. Nevertheless, one major drawback of LLMs is their substantial computational cost for pre-training due to their unprecedented amounts of parameters. The disadvantage is exacerbated when new knowledge frequently needs to be introduced into the pre-trained model. Therefore, it is imperative to develop effective and efficient techniques to update pre-trained LLMs. Traditional methods encode new knowledge in pre-trained LLMs through direct fine-tuning. However, naively re-training LLMs can be computationally intensive and risks degenerating valuable pre-trained knowledge irrelevant to the update in the model. Recently, Knowledge-based Model Editing (KME) has attracted increasing attention, which aims to precisely modify the LLMs to incorporate specific knowledge, without negatively influencing other irrelevant knowledge. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive and in-depth overview of recent advances in the field of KME. We first introduce a general formulation of KME to encompass different KME strategies. Afterward, we provide an innovative taxonomy of KME techniques based on how the new knowledge is introduced into pre-trained LLMs, and investigate existing KME strategies while analyzing key insights, advantages, and limitations of methods from each category. Moreover, representative metrics, datasets, and applications of KME are introduced accordingly. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis regarding the practicality and remaining challenges of KME and suggest promising research directions for further advancement in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Editing for Lifelong Training of Speech Recognition Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17935v2)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) traditionally assumes known domains, but adding data from a new domain raises concerns about computational inefficiencies linked to retraining models on both existing and new domains. Fine-tuning solely on new domain risks Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). To address this, Lifelong Learning (LLL) algorithms have been proposed for ASR. Prior research has explored techniques such as Elastic Weight Consolidation, Knowledge Distillation, and Replay, all of which necessitate either additional parameters or access to prior domain data. We propose Sequential Model Editing as a novel method to continually learn new domains in ASR systems. Different than previous methods, our approach does not necessitate access to prior datasets or the introduction of extra parameters. Our study demonstrates up to 15% Word Error Rate Reduction (WERR) over fine-tuning baseline, and superior efficiency over other LLL techniques on CommonVoice English multi-accent dataset.</p></details> | INTERSPEECH 2024 |

In contrast to existing general-purpose model editing techniques, which unlearn concepts without considering the associated contexts, Moderator allows admins to specify what content should be moderated, under which context, how it should be moderated, and why moderation is necessary. Given a set of policies, Moderator first prompts the original model to generate images that need to be moderated, then uses these self-generated images to reverse fine-tune the model to compute task vectors for moderation and finally negates the original model with the task vectors to decrease its performance in generating moderated content. We evaluated Moderator with 14 participants to play the role of admins and found they could quickly learn and author policies to pass unit tests in approximately 2.29 policy iterations. Our experiment with 32 stable diffusion users suggested that Moderator can prevent 65% of users from generating moderated content under 15 attempts and require the remaining users an average of 8.3 times more attempts to generate undesired content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CCS 2024</p></details> |

This task seeks to adjust the models' responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics since an individual's personality often manifests in the form of their expressed opinions, thereby showcasing different personality traits. Specifically, we construct PersonalityEdit, a new benchmark dataset to address this task. Drawing on the theory in Social Psychology, we isolate three representative traits, namely Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, as the foundation for our benchmark. We then gather data using GPT-4, generating responses that align with a specified topic and embody the targeted personality trait. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various baselines and discuss the representation of personality behavior in LLMs. Our findings uncover potential challenges of the proposed task, illustrating several remaining issues. We anticipate that our work can stimulate further annotation in model editing and personality-related research. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p></details> | NLPCC 2024 |
| **[A Survey on Knowledge Editing of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19704v3)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are becoming increasingly pervasive in academia and industry, matching and surpassing human performance on a wide variety of fields and related tasks. However, just as humans, even the largest artificial neural networks make mistakes, and once-correct predictions can become invalid as the world progresses in time. Augmenting datasets with samples that account for mistakes or up-to-date information has become a common workaround in practical applications. However, the well-known phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting poses a challenge in achieving precise changes in the implicitly memorized knowledge of neural network parameters, often requiring a full model re-training to achieve desired behaviors. That is expensive, unreliable, and incompatible with the current trend of large self-supervised pre-training, making it necessary to find more efficient and effective methods for adapting neural network models to changing data. To address this need, knowledge editing is emerging as a novel area of research that aims to enable reliable, data-efficient, and fast changes to a pre-trained target model, without affecting model behaviors on previously learned tasks. In this survey, we provide a brief review of this recent artificial intelligence field of research. We first introduce the problem of editing neural networks, formalize it in a common framework and differentiate it from more notorious branches of research such as continuous learning. Next, we provide a review of the most relevant knowledge editing approaches and datasets proposed so far, grouping works under four different families: regularization techniques, meta-learning, direct model editing, and architectural strategies. Finally, we outline some intersections with other fields of research and potential directions for future works.</p></details> |  |

| **[AutoDroid-V2: Boosting SLM-based GUI Agents via Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18116v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand powerful large language models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, raising huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pre-trained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.

We introduce Aguvis, a unified vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that directly operates on screen images, standardizes cross-platform interactions and incorporates structured reasoning via inner monologue. To enable this, we construct Aguvis Data Collection, a large-scale dataset with multimodal grounding and reasoning annotations, and develop a two-stage training pipeline that separates GUI grounding from planning and reasoning. Experiments show that Aguvis achieves state-of-the-art performance across offline and real-world online benchmarks, marking the first fully autonomous vision-based GUI agent that operates without closed-source models. We open-source all datasets, models, and training recipes at https://aguvis-project.github.io to advance future research.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Visual Test-time Scaling for GUI Agent Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00684v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model. Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScaleTrack: Scaling and back-tracking Automated GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00416v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step. Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models. Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.</p></details> |  |
| **[OS-Genesis: Automating GUI Agent Trajectory Construction via Reverse Task Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19723v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This paper provides a structured summary of recent advances in GUI agents, focusing on architectures enhanced by Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first formalize GUI agent tasks as Markov Decision Processes and discuss typical execution environments and evaluation metrics. We then review the modular architecture of (M)LLM-based GUI agents, covering Perception, Planning, and Acting modules, and trace their evolution through representative works. Furthermore, we categorize GUI agent training methodologies into Prompt-based, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)-based, and RL-based approaches, highlighting the progression from simple prompt engineering to dynamic policy learning via RL. Our summary illustrates how recent innovations in multimodal perception, decision reasoning, and adaptive action generation have significantly improved the generalization and robustness of GUI agents in complex real-world environments. We conclude by identifying key challenges and future directions for building more capable and reliable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |

This paper systematically reviews LLM-driven phone GUI agents, highlighting their evolution from script-based automation to intelligent, adaptive systems. We first contextualize key challenges, (i) limited generality, (ii) high maintenance overhead, and (iii) weak intent comprehension, and show how LLMs address these issues through advanced language understanding, multimodal perception, and robust decision-making. We then propose a taxonomy covering fundamental agent frameworks (single-agent, multi-agent, plan-then-act), modeling approaches (prompt engineering, training-based), and essential datasets and benchmarks. Furthermore, we detail task-specific architectures, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning strategies that bridge user intent and GUI operations. Finally, we discuss open challenges such as dataset diversity, on-device deployment efficiency, user-centric adaptation, and security concerns, offering forward-looking insights into this rapidly evolving field. By providing a structured overview and identifying pressing research gaps, this paper serves as a definitive reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness LLMs in designing scalable, user-friendly phone GUI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, Project Homepage: https://github.com/PhoneLLM/Awesome-LLM-Powered-Phone-GUI-Agents</p></details> |
| **[Toward a Human-Centered Evaluation Framework for Trustworthy LLM-Powered GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17934v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation through LLM-powered GUI agents, yet their ability to process sensitive data with limited human oversight raises significant privacy and security risks. This position paper identifies three key risks of GUI agents and examines how they differ from traditional GUI automation and general autonomous agents. Despite these risks, existing evaluations focus primarily on performance, leaving privacy and security assessments largely unexplored. We review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI agent design and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[InfiGUI-R1: Advancing Multimodal GUI Agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14239v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have powered Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, showing promise in automating tasks on computing devices. Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks.

Traditional approaches using pre-training or fine-tuning with massive datasets struggle with the diversity of mobile applications and user-specific tasks. We propose enhancing mobile GUI agent capabilities through human demonstrations, focusing on improving performance in unseen scenarios rather than pursuing universal generalization through larger datasets. To realize this paradigm, we introduce LearnGUI, the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for studying demonstration-based learning in mobile GUI agents, comprising 2,252 offline tasks and 101 online tasks with high-quality human demonstrations. We further develop LearnAct, a sophisticated multi-agent framework that automatically extracts knowledge from demonstrations to enhance task completion. This framework integrates three specialized agents: DemoParser for knowledge extraction, KnowSeeker for relevant knowledge retrieval, and ActExecutor for demonstration-enhanced task execution. Our experimental results show significant performance gains in both offline and online evaluations. In offline assessments, a single demonstration improves model performance, increasing Gemini-1.5-Pro's accuracy from 19.3% to 51.7%. In online evaluations, our framework enhances UI-TARS-7B-SFT's task success rate from 18.1% to 32.8%.

However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-E2I-Synth: Advancing GUI Grounding with Large-Scale Instruction Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11257v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models are accelerating the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents that utilize human-like vision perception capabilities to enhance productivity on digital devices. Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding.

However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework.

An ideal GUI agent is expected to achieve high accuracy, low latency, and compatibility for different GUI platforms. Recent vision-based approaches have shown promise by leveraging advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs). While they generally meet the requirements of compatibility and low latency, these vision-based GUI agents tend to have low accuracy due to their limitations in element grounding. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{SpiritSight}$, a vision-based, end-to-end GUI agent that excels in GUI navigation tasks across various GUI platforms. First, we create a multi-level, large-scale, high-quality GUI dataset called $\textbf{GUI-Lasagne}$ using scalable methods, empowering SpiritSight with robust GUI understanding and grounding capabilities.

Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.

However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich, reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then examine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal reasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11 mid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on WebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior assumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets, resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on AndroidWorld.

| **[The Obvious Invisible Threat: LLM-Powered GUI Agents' Vulnerability to Fine-Print Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11281v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Large Language Model (LLM) powered GUI agent is a specialized autonomous system that performs tasks on the user's behalf according to high-level instructions. It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary sequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions such as clicking, typing, and tapping. To complete real-world tasks, such as filling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on sensitive user data. However, this autonomy introduces new privacy and security risks. Adversaries can inject malicious content into the GUIs that alters agent behaviors or induces unintended disclosures of private information. These attacks often exploit the discrepancy between visual saliency for agents and human users, or the agent's limited ability to detect violations of contextual integrity in task automation. In this paper, we characterized six types of such attacks, and conducted an experimental study to test these attacks with six state-of-the-art GUI agents, 234 adversarial webpages, and 39 human participants. Our findings suggest that GUI agents are highly vulnerable, particularly to contextually embedded threats. Moreover, human users are also susceptible to many of these attacks, indicating that simple human oversight may not reliably prevent failures. This misalignment highlights the need for privacy-aware agent design. We propose practical defense strategies to inform the development of safer and more reliable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[AppAgentX: Evolving GUI Agents as Proficient Smartphone Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02268v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of intelligent LLM-based agents capable of interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These agents demonstrate strong reasoning and adaptability, enabling them to perform complex tasks that traditionally required predefined rules. However, the reliance on step-by-step reasoning in LLM-based agents often results in inefficiencies, particularly for routine tasks. In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility. Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts, replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in professional domains remains under-explored. These specialized workflows introduce unique challenges for GUI perception models, including high-resolution displays, smaller target sizes, and complex environments. In this paper, we introduce ScreenSpot-Pro, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the grounding capabilities of MLLMs in high-resolution professional settings. The benchmark comprises authentic high-resolution images from a variety of professional domains with expert annotations. It spans 23 applications across five industries and three operating systems. Existing GUI grounding models perform poorly on this dataset, with the best model achieving only 18.9%. Our experiments reveal that strategically reducing the search area enhances accuracy. Based on this insight, we propose ScreenSeekeR, a visual search method that utilizes the GUI knowledge of a strong planner to guide a cascaded search, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 48.1% without any additional training. We hope that our benchmark and findings will advance the development of GUI agents for professional applications.

However, users often inadvertently omit key information when conveying tasks, which hinders agent performance in the current agent paradigm that does not support immediate user intervention. To address this issue, we introduce a $\textbf{Self-Correction GUI Navigation}$ task that incorporates interactive information completion capabilities within GUI agents. We developed the $\textbf{Navi-plus}$ dataset with GUI follow-up question-answer pairs, alongside a $\textbf{Dual-Stream Trajectory Evaluation}$ method to benchmark this new capability. Our results show that agents equipped with the ability to ask GUI follow-up questions can fully recover their performance when faced with ambiguous user tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, their increasing autonomy has raised critical concerns about their security, privacy, and safety. This survey examines the trustworthiness of GUI agents in five critical dimensions: security vulnerabilities, reliability in dynamic environments, transparency and explainability, ethical considerations, and evaluation methodologies. We also identify major challenges such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, cascading failure modes in sequential decision-making, and a lack of realistic evaluation benchmarks. These issues not only hinder real-world deployment but also call for comprehensive mitigation strategies beyond task success. As GUI agents become more widespread, establishing robust safety standards and responsible development practices is essential.

| **[A Survey on (M)LLM-Based GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13865v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</p></details> |  |

Effective training of these agent presents unique challenges, such as sparsity in supervision signals, scalability for large datasets, and the need for nuanced user understanding. We propose stateful screen schema, an efficient representation of GUI interactions that captures key user actions and intentions over time. Building on this foundation, we introduce ScreenLLM, a set of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) tailored for advanced UI understanding and action prediction. Extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models show that ScreenLLM accurately models user behavior and predicts actions. Our work lays the foundation for scalable, robust, and intelligent GUI agents that enhance user interaction in diverse software environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MM4SG Workshop at The Web Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[GUI-World: A Video Benchmark and Dataset for Multimodal GUI-oriented Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10819v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been used as agents to control keyboard and mouse inputs by directly perceiving the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and generating corresponding commands. However, current agents primarily demonstrate strong understanding capabilities in static environments and are mainly applied to relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Image LLMs and Video LLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that current models struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, Video LLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Therefore, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned Video LLM, GUI-Vid, as a GUI-oriented assistant, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using video LLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding. All the dataset and code are publicly available at: https://gui-world.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Safeguarding Mobile GUI Agent via Logic-based Action Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18492v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have unlocked new possibilities in human-computer interaction, particularly with the rise of mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents capable of interpreting GUIs. These agents promise to revolutionize mobile computing by allowing users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions. However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors. To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. VSA is designed to deterministically ensure that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before conducting an action. At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification, expressed in our domain-specific language (DSL). This enables runtime, rule-based verification, allowing VSA to detect and prevent erroneous actions executing an action, either by providing corrective feedback or halting unsafe behavior. To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agent. effectively bridging the gap between LFM-driven automation and formal software verification. We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LLM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps. The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.3%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, representing a significant 20.4%-25.6% improvement over existing LLM-based verification methods, and consequently increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUI-Xplore: Empowering Generalizable GUI Agents with One Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17709v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI agents hold significant potential to enhance the experience and efficiency of human-device interaction. However, current methods face challenges in generalizing across applications (apps) and tasks, primarily due to two fundamental limitations in existing datasets. First, these datasets overlook developer-induced structural variations among apps, limiting the transferability of knowledge across diverse software environments. Second, many of them focus solely on navigation tasks, which restricts their capacity to represent comprehensive software architectures and complex user interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Xplore, a dataset meticulously designed to enhance cross-application and cross-task generalization via an exploration-and-reasoning framework. GUI-Xplore integrates pre-recorded exploration videos providing contextual insights, alongside five hierarchically structured downstream tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate GUI agent capabilities. To fully exploit GUI-Xplore's unique features, we propose Xplore-Agent, a GUI agent framework that combines Action-aware GUI Modeling with Graph-Guided Environment Reasoning. Further experiments indicate that Xplore-Agent achieves a 10% improvement over existing methods in unfamiliar environments, yet there remains significant potential for further enhancement towards truly generalizable GUI agents.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Unlike previous mobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to directly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid sets a new state-of-the-art task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 9.5%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves an impressively low latency of 0.7 seconds per step, making it the first mobile agent capable of delivering near-real-time, effective decision-making capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 iterations, refine figs</p></details> |
| **[Does Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Help Mobile GUI Agent? An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16788v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning capabilities have significantly improved the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) in domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding, and visual question-answering. However, their impact on real-world applications remains unclear. This paper presents the first empirical study on the effectiveness of reasoning-enabled VLMs in mobile GUI agents, a domain that requires interpreting complex screen layouts, understanding user instructions, and executing multi-turn interactions. We evaluate two pairs of commercial models--Gemini 2.0 Flash and Claude 3.7 Sonnet--comparing their base and reasoning-enhanced versions across two static benchmarks (ScreenSpot and AndroidControl) and one interactive environment (AndroidWorld). We surprisingly find the Claude 3.7 Sonnet reasoning model achieves state-of-the-art performance on AndroidWorld. However, reasoning VLMs generally offer marginal improvements over non-reasoning models on static benchmarks and even degrade performance in some agent setups. Notably, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs fail on different sets of tasks, suggesting that reasoning does have an impact, but its benefits and drawbacks counterbalance each other. We attribute these inconsistencies to the limitations of benchmarks and VLMs. Based on the findings, we provide insights for further enhancing mobile GUI agents in terms of benchmarks, VLMs, and their adaptability in dynamically invoking reasoning VLMs. The experimental data are publicly available at https://github.com/LlamaTouch/VLM-Reasoning-Traces.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose an automated GUI data generation pipeline, AutoCaptioner, which generates data with rich descriptions while minimizing human effort. Using AutoCaptioner, we created a novel large-scale desktop GUI dataset, DeskVision, along with the largest desktop test benchmark, DeskVision-Eval, which reflects daily usage and covers diverse systems and UI elements, each with rich descriptions. With DeskVision, we train a new GUI understanding model, GUIExplorer. Results show that GUIExplorer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in understanding/grounding visual elements without the need for complex architectural designs. We further validated the effectiveness of the DeskVision dataset through ablation studies on various large visual language models (LVLMs). We believe that AutoCaptioner and DeskVision will significantly advance the development of GUI agents, and will open-source them for the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[API Agents vs. GUI Agents: Divergence and Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11069v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have evolved beyond simple text generation to power software agents that directly translate natural language commands into tangible actions. While API-based LLM agents initially rose to prominence for their robust automation capabilities and seamless integration with programmatic endpoints, recent progress in multimodal LLM research has enabled GUI-based LLM agents that interact with graphical user interfaces in a human-like manner. Although these two paradigms share the goal of enabling LLM-driven task automation, they diverge significantly in architectural complexity, development workflows, and user interaction models. This paper presents the first comprehensive comparative study of API-based and GUI-based LLM agents, systematically analyzing their divergence and potential convergence. We examine key dimensions and highlight scenarios in which hybrid approaches can harness their complementary strengths. By proposing clear decision criteria and illustrating practical use cases, we aim to guide practitioners and researchers in selecting, combining, or transitioning between these paradigms. Ultimately, we indicate that continuing innovations in LLM-based automation are poised to blur the lines between API- and GUI-driven agents, paving the way for more flexible, adaptive solutions in a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothing Grounding and Reasoning for MLLM-Powered GUI Agents with Query-Oriented Pivot Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00401v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception-enhanced pre-training, particularly through grounding techniques, is widely adopted to enhance the performance of graphical user interface (GUI) agents. However, in resource-constrained scenarios, the format discrepancy between coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning limits the effectiveness of grounding for reasoning tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a query-oriented pivot approach called query inference, which serves as a bridge between GUI grounding and reasoning. By inferring potential user queries from a screenshot and its associated element coordinates, query inference improves the understanding of coordinates while aligning more closely with reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that query inference outperforms previous grounding techniques under the same training data scale. Notably, query inference achieves comparable or even better performance to large-scale grounding-enhanced OS-Atlas with less than 0.1% of training data. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reasoning formats and demonstrate that integrating additional semantic information into the input further boosts reasoning performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZrW00/GUIPivot.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Navigating the Digital World as Humans Do: Universal Visual Grounding for GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05243v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms. However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

However, a critical yet underexplored issue persists: over-execution, where the agent executes tasks in a fully autonomous way, without adequate assessment of its action confidence to compromise an adaptive human-agent collaboration. This poses substantial risks in complex scenarios, such as those involving ambiguous user instructions, unexpected interruptions, and environmental hijacks. To address the issue, we introduce OS-Kairos, an adaptive GUI agent capable of predicting confidence levels at each interaction step and efficiently deciding whether to act autonomously or seek human intervention. OS-Kairos is developed through two key mechanisms: (i) collaborative probing that annotates confidence scores at each interaction step; (ii) confidence-driven interaction that leverages these confidence scores to elicit the ability of adaptive interaction. Experimental results show that OS-Kairos substantially outperforms existing models on our curated dataset featuring complex scenarios, as well as on established benchmarks such as AITZ and Meta-GUI, with 24.59\%$\sim$87.29\% improvements in task success rate. OS-Kairos facilitates an adaptive human-agent collaboration, prioritizing effectiveness, generality, scalability, and efficiency for real-world GUI interaction.

We propose an environment-free RL framework that decouples value estimation from policy optimization by leveraging a pretrained Value Environment Model (VEM). VEM predicts state-action values directly from offline data, distilling human-like priors about GUI interaction outcomes without requiring next-state prediction or environmental feedback. This avoids compounding errors and enhances resilience to UI changes by focusing on semantic reasoning (e.g., Does this action advance the user's goal?). The framework operates in two stages: (1) pretraining VEM to estimate long-term action utilities and (2) guiding policy exploration with frozen VEM signals, enabling layout-agnostic GUI automation. Evaluated on Android-in-the-Wild benchmarks, VEM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings, outperforming environment-free baselines significantly and matching environment-based approaches without interaction costs. Importantly, VEM demonstrates that semantic-aware value estimation can achieve comparable performance with online-trained methods.</p></details> | 20pages,5 figures |

To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical agent framework named PC-Agent. Specifically, from the perception perspective, we devise an Active Perception Module (APM) to overcome the inadequate abilities of current MLLMs in perceiving screenshot content. From the decision-making perspective, to handle complex user instructions and interdependent subtasks more effectively, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration architecture that decomposes decision-making processes into Instruction-Subtask-Action levels. Within this architecture, three agents (i.e., Manager, Progress and Decision) are set up for instruction decomposition, progress tracking and step-by-step decision-making respectively. Additionally, a Reflection agent is adopted to enable timely bottom-up error feedback and adjustment. We also introduce a new benchmark PC-Eval with 25 real-world complex instructions. Empirical results on PC-Eval show that our PC-Agent achieves a 32% absolute improvement of task success rate over previous state-of-the-art methods.

However, planning remains highly challenging, especially due to sensitivity to the initial state of the environment. Specifically, slight differences in the initial state-such as the target software not being open or the interface not being in its default state-often lead to planning errors. This issue is widespread in real user scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail to evaluate it. In this paper, we present WorldGUI, a novel GUI benchmark that designs GUI tasks with various initial states to simulate real computer-user interactions. The benchmark spans a wide range of tasks across 10 popular software applications, including PowerPoint, VSCode, and Adobe Acrobat. In addition, to address the challenges of dynamic GUI automation tasks, we propose GUI-Thinker, a holistic framework, leveraging a critique mechanism, that effectively manages the unpredictability and complexity of GUI interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that GUI-Thinker significantly outperforms Claude-3.5 (Computer Use) by 14.9% in success rate on WorldGUI tasks. This improvement underscores the effectiveness of our critical-thinking-based framework in enhancing GUI automation.

Mobile GUI agents, a subset of AI agents, are designed to autonomously perform tasks on mobile devices. While numerous studies have introduced agents, datasets, and benchmarks to advance mobile GUI agent research, many existing datasets focus on static frame evaluations and fail to provide a comprehensive platform for assessing performance on real-world, in-the-wild tasks. To address this gap, we present Android Agent Arena (A3), a novel evaluation platform. Unlike existing in-the-wild systems, A3 offers: (1) meaningful and practical tasks, such as real-time online information retrieval and operational instructions; (2) a larger, more flexible action space, enabling compatibility with agents trained on any dataset; and (3) automated business-level LLM-based evaluation process. A3 includes 21 widely used general third-party apps and 201 tasks representative of common user scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating mobile GUI agents in real-world situations and a new autonomous evaluation process for less human labor and coding expertise.

Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle with cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on dataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ Set-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires metadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across platforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks rather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework that enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior works that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI elements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL seamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen Parsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module, which work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and semantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate TRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot, VisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets. Additionally, for GUI referring, TRISHUL surpasses the ToL agent on the ScreenPR benchmark, setting a new standard for robust and adaptable GUI comprehension.</p></details> | 8 pages 5 figures |

| **[WinClick: GUI Grounding with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04730v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) tasks are vital for automating workflows such as software testing, user interface navigation. For users, the GUI is the most intuitive platform for interacting with a computer. Previous work identified a key challenge in developing visual GUI agents: GUI grounding - the ability to accurately locate screen elements based on instructions. However, most existing GUI agents rely on structured data formats like DOM or HTML files in training or inferencing, which are inaccessible across all applications, particular in a general desktop environments such as Windows OS. To address this, we introduce WinClick, a novel visual GUI agent developed in Windows platform. WinClick leverages screenshots to detect actionable regions. To overcome the challenge of GUI grounding, we enhance WinClick with GUI grounding pre-training and propose an LLM-based method for aligning GUI grounding data. Additionally, we introduce WinSpot, the first comprehensive benchmark for GUI grounding on Windows. Our experiments demonstrate that WinClick, combined with GUI grounding pre-training, significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable solution for GUI automation in desktop environments. WinSpot is publicly available at https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/WinSpot.</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-TARS: Pioneering Automated GUI Interaction with Native Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12326v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces UI-TARS, a native GUI agent model that solely perceives the screenshots as input and performs human-like interactions (e.g., keyboard and mouse operations). Unlike prevailing agent frameworks that depend on heavily wrapped commercial models (e.g., GPT-4o) with expert-crafted prompts and workflows, UI-TARS is an end-to-end model that outperforms these sophisticated frameworks. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance: UI-TARS achieves SOTA performance in 10+ GUI agent benchmarks evaluating perception, grounding, and GUI task execution. Notably, in the OSWorld benchmark, UI-TARS achieves scores of 24.6 with 50 steps and 22.7 with 15 steps, outperforming Claude (22.0 and 14.9 respectively). In AndroidWorld, UI-TARS achieves 46.6, surpassing GPT-4o (34.5). UI-TARS incorporates several key innovations: (1) Enhanced Perception: leveraging a large-scale dataset of GUI screenshots for context-aware understanding of UI elements and precise captioning; (2) Unified Action Modeling, which standardizes actions into a unified space across platforms and achieves precise grounding and interaction through large-scale action traces; (3) System-2 Reasoning, which incorporates deliberate reasoning into multi-step decision making, involving multiple reasoning patterns such as task decomposition, reflection thinking, milestone recognition, etc. (4) Iterative Training with Reflective Online Traces, which addresses the data bottleneck by automatically collecting, filtering, and reflectively refining new interaction traces on hundreds of virtual machines. Through iterative training and reflection tuning, UI-TARS continuously learns from its mistakes and adapts to unforeseen situations with minimal human intervention. We also analyze the evolution path of GUI agents to guide the further development of this domain.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can assist people in tasks like writing emails, but struggle to understand and interact with GUIs, thus limiting their potential to increase automation levels. In this paper, we introduce CogAgent, an 18-billion-parameter visual language model (VLM) specializing in GUI understanding and navigation. By utilizing both low-resolution and high-resolution image encoders, CogAgent supports input at a resolution of 1120*1120, enabling it to recognize tiny page elements and text. As a generalist visual language model, CogAgent achieves the state of the art on five text-rich and four general VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, OK-VQA, Text-VQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, infoVQA, DocVQA, MM-Vet, and POPE. CogAgent, using only screenshots as input, outperforms LLM-based methods that consume extracted HTML text on both PC and Android GUI navigation tasks -- Mind2Web and AITW, advancing the state of the art.

However, current research focuses on GUI task automation, limiting the scope of applications in various GUI scenarios. In this paper, we propose a formalized and comprehensive environment to evaluate the entire process of automated GUI Testing (GTArena), offering a fair, standardized environment for consistent operation of diverse multimodal large language models. We divide the testing process into three key subtasks: test intention generation, test task execution, and GUI defect detection, and construct a benchmark dataset based on these to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. It evaluates the performance of different models using three data types: real mobile applications, mobile applications with artificially injected defects, and synthetic data, thoroughly assessing their capabilities in this relevant task. Additionally, we propose a method that helps researchers explore the correlation between the performance of multimodal language large models in specific scenarios and their general capabilities in standard benchmark tests. Experimental results indicate that even the most advanced models struggle to perform well across all sub-tasks of automated GUI Testing, highlighting a significant gap between the current capabilities of Autonomous GUI Testing and its practical, real-world applicability. This gap provides guidance for the future direction of GUI Agent development. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZJU-ACES-ISE/ChatUITest.</p></details> |  |

These agents autonomously interact with digital systems or software applications via GUIs, emulating human actions such as clicking, typing, and navigating visual elements across diverse platforms. Motivated by the growing interest and fundamental importance of GUI agents, we provide a comprehensive survey that categorizes their benchmarks, evaluation metrics, architectures, and training methods. We propose a unified framework that delineates their perception, reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities. Furthermore, we identify important open challenges and discuss key future directions.

| **[Falcon-UI: Understanding GUI Before Following User Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09362v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pursuing human-like interaction for Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents requires understanding the GUI context and following user instructions. However, existing works typically couple these two aspects and focus more on instruct-following abilities, while ignoring the importance of understanding the GUI context. In this paper, we introduce an instruction-free GUI navigation dataset, termed Insight-UI Dataset, to enhance model comprehension of GUI environments. Insight-UI Dataset is automatically generated from the Common Crawl corpus, simulating various platforms -- including iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux -- across multiple resolutions on 312K domains. Although GUI interactions vary by context, diverse interfaces share common internal patterns, such as clicking an item to view its details. It implies the feasibility of independent GUI operation learning, followed by joint optimization with instruction tuning. Thereby, we develop the GUI agent model Falcon-UI, which is initially pretrained on Insight-UI Dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on Android and Web GUI datasets, including AITW, AITZ, Android Control, and Mind2Web. With 7 billion parameters, Falcon-UI achieves accuracy comparable to the 72 billion-parameter Qwen2VL on AITZ, validating the alignment between GUI context comprehension and agent performance. Our code and dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |
| **[MobileFlow: A Multimodal LLM For Mobile GUI Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04346v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the integration of mobile Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is ubiquitous in most people's daily lives. And the ongoing evolution of multimodal large-scale models, such as GPT-4v, Qwen-VL-Max, has significantly bolstered the capabilities of GUI comprehension and user action analysis, showcasing the potentiality of intelligent GUI assistants. However, current GUI Agents often need to access page layout information through calling system APIs, which may pose privacy risks. Fixing GUI (such as mobile interfaces) to a certain low resolution might result in the loss of fine-grained image details. At the same time, the multimodal large models built for GUI Agents currently have poor understanding and decision-making abilities for Chinese GUI interfaces, making them difficult to apply to a large number of Chinese apps. This paper introduces MobileFlow, a multimodal large language model meticulously crafted for mobile GUI agents. Transforming from the open-source model Qwen-VL-Chat into GUI domain, MobileFlow contains approximately 21 billion parameters and is equipped with novel hybrid visual encoders, making it possible for variable resolutions of image inputs and good support for multilingual GUI. By incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoE) expansions and pioneering alignment training strategies, MobileFlow has the capacity to fully interpret image data and comprehend user instructions for GUI interaction tasks. Finally, MobileFlow outperforms Qwen-VL-Max and GPT-4v in terms of task execution by GUI agents on both public and our proposed evaluation metrics, and has been successfully deployed in real-world business contexts, proving its effectiveness for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ponder & Press: Advancing Visual GUI Agent towards General Computer Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01268v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing GUI agents typically depend on non-vision inputs like HTML source code or accessibility trees, limiting their flexibility across diverse software environments and platforms. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which excel at using vision to ground real-world objects, offer a potential alternative. However, they often struggle with accurately localizing GUI elements -- a critical requirement for effective GUI automation -- due to the semantic gap between real-world objects and GUI elements. In this work, we introduce Ponder & Press, a divide-and-conquer framework for general computer control using only visual input. Our approach combines an general-purpose MLLM as an 'interpreter', responsible for translating high-level user instructions into detailed action descriptions, with a GUI-specific MLLM as a 'locator' that precisely locates GUI elements for action placement. By leveraging a purely visual input, our agent offers a versatile, human-like interaction paradigm applicable to a wide range of applications. Ponder & Press locator outperforms existing models by +22.5% on the ScreenSpot GUI grounding benchmark. Both offline and interactive agent benchmarks across various GUI environments -- including web pages, desktop software, and mobile UIs -- demonstrate that Ponder & Press framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the potential of visual GUI agents.

As an early beta, its capability in the real-world complex environment remains unknown. In this case study to explore Claude 3.5 Computer Use, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed tasks spanning a variety of domains and software. Observations from these cases demonstrate Claude 3.5 Computer Use's unprecedented ability in end-to-end language to desktop actions. Along with this study, we provide an out-of-the-box agent framework for deploying API-based GUI automation models with easy implementation. Our case studies aim to showcase a groundwork of capabilities and limitations of Claude 3.5 Computer Use with detailed analyses and bring to the fore questions about planning, action, and critic, which must be considered for future improvement.

| **[OS-ATLAS: A Foundation Action Model for Generalist GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23218v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing efforts in building GUI agents heavily rely on the availability of robust commercial Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and GeminiProVision. Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Agent S aims to address three key challenges in automating computer tasks: acquiring domain-specific knowledge, planning over long task horizons, and handling dynamic, non-uniform interfaces. To this end, Agent S introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning, which learns from external knowledge search and internal experience retrieval at multiple levels, facilitating efficient task planning and subtask execution. In addition, it employs an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to better elicit the reasoning and control capabilities of GUI agents based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark shows that Agent S outperforms the baseline by 9.37% on success rate (an 83.6% relative improvement) and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Comprehensive analysis highlights the effectiveness of individual components and provides insights for future improvements. Furthermore, Agent S demonstrates broad generalizability to different operating systems on a newly-released WindowsAgentArena benchmark.

A general setting is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using our simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness (i.e., action accuracy) of multimodal agents, our findings indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions, resulting in unfaithful behaviors. Furthermore, we switch to the adversarial perspective and implement environment injection, demonstrating that such unfaithfulness can be exploited, leading to unexpected risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniParser for Pure Vision Based GUI Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00203v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.</p></details> |  |

Even though the task highly relies on past actions and visual observations, existing studies typically consider little semantic information carried out by intermediate screenshots and screen operations. To address this, this work presents Chain-of-Action-Thought (dubbed CoAT), which takes the description of the previous actions, the current screen, and more importantly the action thinking of what actions should be performed and the outcomes led by the chosen action. We demonstrate that, in a zero-shot setting upon three off-the-shelf LMMs, CoAT significantly improves the action prediction compared to previous proposed context modeling. To further facilitate the research in this line, we construct a dataset Android-In-The-Zoo (AitZ), which contains 18,643 screen-action pairs together with chain-of-action-thought annotations. Experiments show that fine-tuning a 1B model (i.e. AUTO-UI-base) on our AitZ dataset achieves on-par performance with CogAgent-Chat-18B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset could be found in https://github.com/IMNearth/CoAT</p></details> |

To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios, we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX), a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents. Their capabilities of completing complex tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices are trained and evaluated with the proposed dataset. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from 110 popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing mobile device-control datasets, e.g., MoTIF, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions, each averaging 13 steps with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective, complementing the general settings of existing datasets. Additionally, we develop a baseline model SPHINX Agent and compare its performance across state-of-the-art agents trained on other datasets. To facilitate further research, we open-source our dataset, models, and relevant evaluation tools. The project is available at https://yuxiangchai.github.io/AMEX/</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) highlight the compelling potential to develop versatile agents to help humans finish GUI navigation tasks. However, current VLMs are challenged in terms of fundamental abilities (OCR and grounding) and GUI knowledge (the functions and control methods of GUI elements), preventing them from becoming practical GUI agents. To solve these challenges, we contribute GUICourse, a suite of datasets to train visual-based GUI agents from general VLMs. First, we introduce the GUIEnv dataset to strengthen the OCR and grounding capabilities of VLMs. Then, we introduce the GUIAct and GUIChat datasets to enrich their knowledge of GUI components and interactions. Experiments demonstrate that our GUI agents have better performance on common GUI tasks than their baseline VLMs. Even the small-size GUI agent (with 3.1B parameters) can still work well on single-step and multi-step GUI tasks. Finally, we analyze the different varieties in the training stage of this agent by ablation study. Our source codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/yiye3/GUICourse.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) offers the chance to create advanced GUI agents. To ensure their effectiveness, there's a pressing need for qualified benchmarks that provide trustworthy and reproducible evaluations -- a challenge current benchmarks often fail to address. To tackle this issue, we introduce Mobile-Env, a comprehensive toolkit tailored for creating GUI benchmarks in the Android mobile environment. Mobile-Env offers an isolated and controllable setting for reliable evaluations, and accommodates intermediate instructions and rewards to reflect real-world usage more naturally. Utilizing Mobile-Env, we collect an open-world task set across various real-world apps and a fixed world set, WikiHow, which captures a significant amount of dynamic online contents for fully controllable and reproducible evaluation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of LLM agents using these benchmarks. Our findings reveal that even advanced models (e.g., GPT-4V and LLaMA-3) struggle with tasks that are relatively simple for humans. This highlights a crucial gap in current models and underscores the importance of developing more capable foundation models and more effective GUI agent frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) navigation agents can enhance user experience in communication, entertainment, and productivity by streamlining workflows and reducing manual intervention. However, prior GUI agents often trained with datasets comprising simple tasks that can be completed within a single app, leading to poor performance in cross-app navigation. To address this problem, we introduce GUI Odyssey, a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating cross-app navigation agents. GUI Odyssey consists of 7,735 episodes from 6 mobile devices, spanning 6 types of cross-app tasks, 201 apps, and 1.4K app combos. Leveraging GUI Odyssey, we developed OdysseyAgent, a multimodal cross-app navigation agent by fine-tuning the Qwen-VL model with a history resampling module. Extensive experiments demonstrate OdysseyAgent's superior accuracy compared to existing models. For instance, OdysseyAgent surpasses fine-tuned Qwen-VL and zero-shot GPT-4V by 1.44\% and 55.49\% in-domain accuracy, and 2.29\% and 48.14\% out-of-domain accuracy on average.

| **[You Only Look at Screens: Multimodal Chain-of-Action Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11436v4)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous graphical user interface (GUI) agents aim to facilitate task automation by interacting with the user interface without manual intervention. Recent studies have investigated eliciting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for effective engagement in diverse environments. To align with the input-output requirement of LLMs, most existing approaches are developed under a sandbox setting where they rely on external tools and application-specific APIs to parse the environment into textual elements and interpret the predicted actions. Consequently, those approaches often grapple with inference inefficiency and error propagation risks. To mitigate the challenges, we introduce Auto-GUI, a multimodal solution that directly interacts with the interface, bypassing the need for environment parsing or reliance on application-dependent APIs. Moreover, we propose a chain-of-action technique -- leveraging a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans -- to help the agent decide what action to execute. We evaluate our approach on a new device-control benchmark AITW with 30$K$ unique instructions, spanning multi-step tasks such as application operation, web searching, and web shopping. Experimental results show that Auto-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance with an action type prediction accuracy of 90\% and an overall action success rate of 74\%.

However, those GUI agents require comprehensive cognition ability including exhaustive perception and reliable action response. We propose a Comprehensive Cognitive LLM Agent, CoCo-Agent, with two novel approaches, comprehensive environment perception (CEP) and conditional action prediction (CAP), to systematically improve the GUI automation performance. First, CEP facilitates the GUI perception through different aspects and granularity, including screenshots and complementary detailed layouts for the visual channel and historical actions for the textual channel. Second, CAP decomposes the action prediction into sub-problems: action type prediction and action target conditioned on the action type. With our technical design, our agent achieves new state-of-the-art performance on AITW and META-GUI benchmarks, showing promising abilities in realistic scenarios.

Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, Counting and \etc. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scaling up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details, and significantly improves multimodal perception ability especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize any objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC, phrase grounding, and REG tasks, and outperform expert models in object detection and object counting.

Most existing GUI agents interact with the environment through extracted structured data, which can be notably lengthy (e.g., HTML) and occasionally inaccessible (e.g., on desktops). To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel visual GUI agent -- SeeClick, which only relies on screenshots for task automation. In our preliminary study, we have discovered a key challenge in developing visual GUI agents: GUI grounding -- the capacity to accurately locate screen elements based on instructions. To tackle this challenge, we propose to enhance SeeClick with GUI grounding pre-training and devise a method to automate the curation of GUI grounding data. Along with the efforts above, we have also created ScreenSpot, the first realistic GUI grounding benchmark that encompasses mobile, desktop, and web environments. After pre-training, SeeClick demonstrates significant improvement in ScreenSpot over various baselines. Moreover, comprehensive evaluations on three widely used benchmarks consistently support our finding that advancements in GUI grounding directly correlate with enhanced performance in downstream GUI agent tasks. The model, data and code are available at https://github.com/njucckevin/SeeClick.</p></details> |  |

| **[SEAL: Steerable Reasoning Calibration of Large Language Models for Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07986v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1-series have demonstrated compelling capabilities for complex reasoning tasks via the extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism. However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/SEAL.</p></details> |  |

While techniques like fine-tuning can modify model behavior, they typically require extensive computational resources. Recent work has introduced a class of contrastive activation engineering (CAE) techniques as promising approaches for steering LLM outputs through targeted modifications to their internal representations. Applied at inference-time with zero cost, CAE has the potential to introduce a new paradigm of flexible, task-specific LLM behavior tuning. We analyze the performance of CAE in in-distribution, out-of-distribution settings, evaluate drawbacks, and begin to develop comprehensive guidelines for its effective deployment. We find that 1. CAE is only reliably effective when applied to in-distribution contexts. 2. Increasing the number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns at around 80 samples. 3. Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverses the behavior that is steered for. 4. Steering vectors harm the overall model perplexity. 5. Larger models are more resistant to steering-induced degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the ICLR 2025 Bi-Align, HAIC, and Building Trust workshops</p></details> |
| **[Statistical Performance of Generalized Direction Detectors with Known Spatial Steering Vector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03076v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalized direction detection (GDD) problem involves determining the presence of a signal of interest within matrix-valued data, where the row and column spaces of the signal (if present) are known, but the speciffc coordinates are unknown. Many detectors have been proposed for GDD, yet there is a lack of analytical results regarding their statistical detection performance. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of two adaptive detectors for GDD in scenarios with known spatial steering vectors. Speciffcally, we establish their statistical distributions and develop closed-form expressions for both detection probability (PD) and false alarm probability (PFA). Simulation experiments are carried out to validate the theoretical results, demonstrating good agreement between theoretical and simulated results.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages,2 figures.This manuscript is accepted by Signal Processing Letters</p></details> |
| **[Activation Space Interventions Can Be Transferred Between Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04429v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of representation universality in AI models reveals growing convergence across domains, modalities, and architectures. However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder mappings between base and fine-tuned models can serve as reliable ``lightweight safety switches", allowing dynamic toggling between model behaviors.</p></details> | 68 pages |
| **[Analyzing the Generalization and Reliability of Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12404v8)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors (SVs) have been proposed as an effective approach to adjust language model behaviour at inference time by intervening on intermediate model activations. They have shown promise in terms of improving both capabilities and model alignment. However, the reliability and generalisation properties of this approach are unknown. In this work, we rigorously investigate these properties, and show that steering vectors have substantial limitations both in- and out-of-distribution. In-distribution, steerability is highly variable across different inputs. Depending on the concept, spurious biases can substantially contribute to how effective steering is for each input, presenting a challenge for the widespread use of steering vectors. Out-of-distribution, while steering vectors often generalise well, for several concepts they are brittle to reasonable changes in the prompt, resulting in them failing to generalise well. Overall, our findings show that while steering can work well in the right circumstances, there remain technical difficulties of applying steering vectors to guide models' behaviour at scale.

| **[On the Limitations of Steering in Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01162v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors are a promising approach to aligning language model behavior at inference time. In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the limitations of steering vectors as alignment mechanisms. Using a framework of transformer hook interventions and antonym-based function vectors, we evaluate the role of prompt structure and context complexity in steering effectiveness. Our findings indicate that steering vectors are promising for specific alignment tasks, such as value alignment, but may not provide a robust foundation for general-purpose alignment in LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. We establish a methodological foundation for future investigations into steering capabilities of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Away from Harm: An Adaptive Approach to Defending Vision Language Model Against Jailbreaks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16721v3)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) can produce unintended and harmful content when exposed to adversarial attacks, particularly because their vision capabilities create new vulnerabilities. Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing, adversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often impractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this challenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively steering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks. Our key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing the direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to remove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering vectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and identify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then used to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive steering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and calibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs while strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks. Additionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against unseen attacks (i.e., structured-based attack, perturbation-based attack with project gradient descent variants, and text-only attack).

| **[Shared Global and Local Geometry of Language Model Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21073v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have recently suggested that models share common representations. In our work, we find that token embeddings of language models exhibit common geometric structure. First, we find ``global'' similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, we characterize local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding. Our intrinsic dimension demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold. We qualitatively show that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow us to find similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that alignment in token embeddings persists through the hidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for interpretability. Namely, we introduce Emb2Emb, a simple method to transfer steering vectors from one language model to another, despite the two models having different dimensions.</p></details> |  |

EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

| **[FairSteer: Inference Time Debiasing for LLMs with Dynamic Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14492v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are prone to capturing biases from training corpus, leading to potential negative social impacts. Existing prompt-based debiasing methods exhibit instability due to their sensitivity to prompt changes, while fine-tuning-based techniques incur substantial computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose FairSteer, a novel inference-time debiasing framework without requiring customized prompt design or model retraining. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, our preliminary investigation demonstrates that fairness-related features can be encoded into separable directions in the hidden activation space. FairSteer operates in three steps: biased activation detection, debiasing steering vector (DSV) computation, and dynamic activation steering. Specifically, it first trains a lightweight linear classifier to detect bias signatures in activations, and then computes DSVs as intervention directions derived from small contrastive prompt pairs. Subsequently, it performs debiasing by adjusting activations with DSVs in the inference stage. Comprehensive evaluation with six LLMs demonstrates the superiority of FairSteer across question-answering, counterfactual input evaluation and open-ended text generation tasks. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Instruction-Following in Language Models through Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12877v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to follow instructions is crucial for numerous real-world applications of language models. In pursuit of deeper insights and more powerful capabilities, we derive instruction-specific vector representations from language models and use them to steer models accordingly. These vectors are computed as the difference in activations between inputs with and without instructions, enabling a modular approach to activation steering. We demonstrate how this method can enhance model adherence to constraints such as output format, length, and word inclusion, providing inference-time control over instruction following. Our experiments across four models demonstrate how we can use the activation vectors to guide models to follow constraints even without explicit instructions and to enhance performance when instructions are present. Additionally, we explore the compositionality of activation steering, successfully applying multiple instructions simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that steering vectors computed on instruction-tuned models can transfer to improve base models. Our findings demonstrate that activation steering offers a practical and scalable approach for fine-grained control in language generation. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/llm-steer-instruct.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Activation Patching for Interpretable Steering in Music Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04479v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how large audio models represent music, and using that understanding to steer generation, is both challenging and underexplored. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability in language models, where direction vectors in transformer residual streams are key to model analysis and control, we investigate similar techniques in the audio domain. This paper presents the first study of latent direction vectors in large audio models and their use for continuous control of musical attributes in text-to-music generation. Focusing on binary concepts like tempo (fast vs. slow) and timbre (bright vs. dark), we compute steering vectors using the difference-in-means method on curated prompt sets. These vectors, scaled by a coefficient and injected into intermediate activations, allow fine-grained modulation of specific musical traits while preserving overall audio quality. We analyze the effect of steering strength, compare injection strategies, and identify layers with the greatest influence. Our findings highlight the promise of direction-based steering as a more mechanistic and interpretable approach to controllable music generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Steering of Large Language Models with Feature Guided Activation Additions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09929v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective and reliable control over large language model (LLM) behavior is a significant challenge. While activation steering methods, which add steering vectors to a model's hidden states, are a promising approach, existing techniques often lack precision and interpretability in how they influence model outputs. We introduce Feature Guided Activation Additions (FGAA), a novel activation steering method that leverages insights from Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS). By operating in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and employing optimization techniques to select desired SAE features, FGAA constructs precise steering vectors that provide better steering effects while maintaining coherence of steered model outputs. In this regard, evaluations on Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models across various steering tasks demonstrate that FGAA outperforms existing steering methods of CAA, SAE decoder steering, and SAE-TS. Our results also highlight important trade-offs between steering scale and general model capabilities that are consistent across all tested steering methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 maintext pages, 13 appendix pages</p></details> |

Continuously updating models to avoid degradation is expensive. Can models be adapted without updating model weights? We present TARDIS, an unsupervised representation editing method that addresses this challenge. TARDIS extracts steering vectors from unlabeled data and adjusts the model's representations to better align with the target time period's distribution. Our experiments reveal that TARDIS enhances downstream task performance without the need for fine-tuning, can mitigate temporal misalignment even when exact target time period data is unavailable, and remains efficient even when the temporal information of the target data points is unknown at inference time.</p></details> |  |

We inject steering vectors, derived from LM activations, into LMs during inference time and study whether these vectors can induce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LMs without the need for natural language prompting. We demonstrate this approach on Llama3 8B Instruct and Mistral 7B v0.2 Instruct and show that activation-space interventions achieve competitive, if not superior, performance compared to traditional CoT prompting across multiple reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8k, MMLU, AGI Eval, and ARC AI2. These findings suggest that neural network activations can encode reasoning patterns, offering a new application of activation space manipulation as a tool for tuning model behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was presented at the Workshop on Neural Network Weights as a New Data Modality at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, their responses are influenced by societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to undesirable differences in how the model responds when presented with images depicting people of different demographics. In this work, we propose a training-free debiasing framework for LMMs that intervenes on the model's representations during text generation by constructing a steering vector that reduces reference on protected attributes. Our framework introduces two complementary methods: (1) a dataset-based approach that constructs a steering vector by contrasting model activations on biased and neutral inputs, and (2) a novel optimization-based approach designed for low-resource settings, which constructs the steering vector using a single step of gradient-based perturbation without requiring additional data. Our experiments show that these interventions effectively reduce the propensity of LMMs to generate text related to protected attributes while maintaining sentiment and fluency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that debiased LMMs achieve comparable accuracy to their unmodified counterparts on downstream tasks, indicating that bias mitigation can be achieved without sacrificing model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 Figures, 8 Tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.13976</p></details> |

Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering) a training-free framework for controllable image generation using steering vectors to influence a diffusion model$'$s hidden representations dynamically. CASteer computes these vectors offline by averaging activations from concept-specific generated images, then applies them during inference via a dynamic heuristic that activates modifications only when necessary, removing concepts from affected images or adding them to unaffected ones. This approach enables precise control over a wide range of tasks, including removing harmful content, adding desired attributes, replacing objects, or altering styles, all without model retraining. CASteer handles both concrete and abstract concepts, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across multiple diffusion models while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects.</p></details> |  |

We employ Bayesian optimization to systematically identify effective contrastive pair datasets across nine bias axes. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.2%, 4.7%, and 3.2% over the baseline for Mistral, Llama, and Qwen, respectively. Building on these promising results, we introduce Steering Vector Ensembles (SVE), a method that averages multiple individually optimized steering vectors, each targeting a specific bias axis such as age, race, or gender. By leveraging their collective strength, SVE outperforms individual steering vectors in both bias reduction and maintaining model performance. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that SVE is a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Effectively Steer LLM To Follow Preference via Building Confident Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02989v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Having an LLM that aligns with human preferences is essential for accommodating individual needs, such as maintaining writing style or generating specific topics of interest. The majority of current alignment methods rely on fine-tuning or prompting, which can be either costly or difficult to control. Model steering algorithms, which modify the model output by constructing specific steering directions, are typically easy to implement and optimization-free. However, their capabilities are typically limited to steering the model into one of the two directions (i.e., bidirectional steering), and there has been no theoretical understanding to guarantee their performance. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to understand and quantify the model steering methods. Inspired by the framework, we propose a confident direction steering method (CONFST) that steers LLMs via modifying their activations at inference time. More specifically, CONFST builds a confident direction that is closely aligned with users' preferences, and this direction is then added to the activations of the LLMs to effectively steer the model output. Our approach offers three key advantages over popular bidirectional model steering methods: 1) It is more powerful, since multiple (i.e. more than two) users' preferences can be aligned simultaneously; 2) It is simple to implement, since there is no need to determine which layer to add the steering vector to; 3) No explicit user instruction is required. We validate our method on GPT-2 XL (1.5B), Mistral (7B) and Gemma-it (9B) models for tasks that require shifting the output of LLMs across various topics and styles, achieving superior performance over competing methods.</p></details> |  |

Even Simple Baselines Outperform Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17148v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches have leveraged the latent space of LLMs for hallucination detection, but their embeddings, optimized for linguistic coherence rather than factual accuracy, often fail to clearly separate truthful and hallucinated content. To this end, we propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), a lightweight and flexible steering vector that reshapes the LLM's representation space during inference to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated outputs, without altering model parameters. Our two-stage framework first trains TSV on a small set of labeled exemplars to form compact and well-separated clusters. It then augments the exemplar set with unlabeled LLM generations, employing an optimal transport-based algorithm for pseudo-labeling combined with a confidence-based filtering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSV achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, exhibiting strong generalization across datasets and providing a practical solution for real-world LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR Workshop on Quantify Uncertainty and Hallucination in Foundation Models (QUESTION), 2025</p></details> |

This gap between "knowing" and "telling" poses a challenge for ensuring the truthfulness of generated content. Inspired by recent work on the practice of encoding human-interpretable concepts linearly within large language models, we treat truthfulness as a specially linearly encoded concept within LLMs, and introduce Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method that adaptively shifts LLM's activations in the "truthful" direction during inference. ACT addresses diverse categories of hallucinations by utilizing diverse truthfulness-related steering vectors and adjusting the steering intensity adaptively. Applied as an add-on across various models, ACT significantly improves truthfulness in LLaMA ($\uparrow$ 142%), LLaMA2 ($\uparrow$ 24%), Alpaca ($\uparrow$ 36%), Vicuna ($\uparrow$ 28%), LLaMA2-Chat ($\uparrow$ 19%), and LLaMA3($\uparrow$ 34%). Furthermore, we verify ACT's scalability across larger models (13B, 33B, 65B), underscoring the adaptability of ACT to large-scale language models.

| **[Investigating Generalization of One-shot LLM Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18862v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors have emerged as a promising approach for interpreting and controlling LLMs, but current methods typically require large contrastive datasets that are often impractical to construct and may capture spurious correlations. We propose directly optimizing steering vectors through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these vectors generalize. We consider several steering optimization techniques, including multiple novel ones, and find that the resulting vectors effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot steering vectors that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized steering vectors can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, to quantitatively assess steering effectiveness in instruction-tuned models, we develop a novel evaluation framework using sequence probabilities from the corresponding base model. With this framework, we analyze how steering vectors modulate an instruction-tuned LLM's ability to recover from outputting false information, and find that this ability derives from the base model. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing steering vectors on a single example can mediate misaligned behavior in LLMs, and provide a path toward better understanding the relationship between LLM behavior and activation space structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Semantics-Adaptive Activation Intervention for LLMs via Dynamic Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12299v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many tasks, yet aligning them with desired behaviors remains challenging. Activation intervention has emerged as an effective and economical method to modify the behavior of LLMs. Despite considerable interest in this area, current intervention methods exclusively employ a fixed steering vector to modify model activations, lacking adaptability to diverse input semantics. To address this limitation, we propose Semantics-Adaptive Dynamic Intervention (SADI), a novel method that constructs a dynamic steering vector to intervene model activations at inference time. More specifically, SADI utilizes activation differences in contrastive pairs to precisely identify critical elements of an LLM (i.e., attention heads, hidden states, and neurons) for targeted intervention. During inference, SADI dynamically steers model behavior by scaling element-wise activations based on the directions of input semantics. Experimental results show that SADI outperforms established baselines by substantial margins, improving task performance without training. SADI's cost-effectiveness and generalizability across various LLM backbones and tasks highlight its potential as a versatile alignment technique.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Flexible Framework for Linear Representation Hypothesis Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16385v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of LLMs. Park et al. (2024) formalize this notion by unifying multiple interpretations of linear representation, such as 1-dimensional subspace representation and interventions, using a causal inner product. However, their framework relies on single-token counterfactual pairs and cannot handle ambiguous contrasting pairs, limiting its applicability to complex or context-dependent concepts. We introduce a new notion of binary concepts as unit vectors in a canonical representation space, and utilize LLMs' (neural) activation differences along with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to compute concept directions (i.e., steering vectors). Our method, Sum of Activation-base Normalized Difference (SAND), formalizes the use of activation differences modeled as samples from a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, providing a principled approach to derive concept directions. We extend the applicability of Park et al. (2024) by eliminating the dependency on unembedding representations and single-token pairs. Through experiments with LLaMA models across diverse concepts and benchmarks, we demonstrate that our lightweight approach offers greater flexibility, superior performance in activation engineering tasks like monitoring and manipulation.</p></details> |  |

However, we show that current LLMs make key decisions in a representation space closest to English, regardless of their input and output languages. Exploring the internal representations with a logit lens for sentences in French, German, Dutch, and Mandarin, we show that the LLM first emits representations close to English for semantically-loaded words before translating them into the target language. We further show that activation steering in these LLMs is more effective when the steering vectors are computed in English rather than in the language of the inputs and outputs. This suggests that multilingual LLMs perform key reasoning steps in a representation that is heavily shaped by English in a way that is not transparent to system users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper 9 pages; including appendix 48 pages</p></details> |

However, existing ITI approaches fail to scale to multi-attribute settings with conflicts, such as enhancing helpfulness while also reducing toxicity. To address this, we introduce Multi-Attribute Targeted Steering (MAT-Steer), a novel steering framework designed for selective token-level intervention across multiple attributes. MAT-Steer learns steering vectors using an alignment objective that shifts the model's internal representations of undesirable outputs closer to those of desirable ones while enforcing sparsity and orthogonality among vectors for different attributes, thereby reducing inter-attribute conflicts. We evaluate MAT-Steer in two distinct settings: (i) on question answering (QA) tasks where we balance attributes like truthfulness, bias, and toxicity; (ii) on generative tasks where we simultaneously improve attributes like helpfulness, correctness, and coherence. MAT-Steer outperforms existing ITI and parameter-efficient finetuning approaches across both task types (e.g., 3% average accuracy gain across QA tasks and 55.82% win rate against the best ITI baseline).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, code link: https://github.com/duykhuongnguyen/MAT-Steer</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Beamforming with Widely-spaced-array for Multi-user Cross-Near-and-Far-Field Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04682v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With multi-GHz bandwidth, Terahertz (THz) beamforming has drawn increasing attention in the sixth generation (6G) and beyond communications. Existing beamforming designs mainly focus on a compact antenna array where typical communication occurs in the far-field. However, in dense multi-user scenarios, only relying on far-field angle domain fails to distinguish users at similar angles. Therefore, a multi-user widely-spaced array (MU-WSA) is exploited in this paper, which enlarges the near-field region to introduce the additional distance domain, leading to a new paradigm of cross-near-and-far-field (CNFF) communication. Under this paradigm, the CNFF channel model is investigated, based on which the subarray spacing $d_s$ and the number of subarrays $K$ in MU-WSA are optimized to maximize the channel capacity. Then, in sub-connected systems, an alternating optimization (AO) beamforming algorithm is proposed to deal with the special block-diagonal format of the analog precoder. For fully-connected systems, a low-complexity steering-vector reconstruction (SVR)-based algorithm is proposed by constructing specialized steering vectors of MU-WSA. Numerical evaluations show that due to distance domain resolutions, the MU-WSA can improve the SE by over $60$% at a power of $20$dBm compared to the compact array. Additionally, the proposed AO algorithm in the SC system can achieve over 80% of the sum (SE) of the FC system while reducing the number of phase shifters by $K^2$, thereby lowering power consumption. The SVR algorithm in the FC system can achieve over 95% of the upper bound of SE but takes only 10% of the running time of the singular vector decomposition (SVD)-based algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Understanding and Evaluation of Steering Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02716v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering methods provide a practical approach to controlling large language models by applying steering vectors to intermediate activations, guiding outputs toward desired behaviors while avoiding retraining. Despite their growing importance, the field lacks a unified understanding and consistent evaluation across tasks and datasets, hindering progress. This paper introduces a unified framework for analyzing and evaluating steering methods, formalizing their core principles and offering theoretical insights into their effectiveness. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations on multiple-choice and open-ended text generation tasks, we validate these insights, identifying key factors that influence performance and demonstrating the superiority of certain methods. Our work bridges theoretical and practical perspectives, offering actionable guidance for advancing the design, optimization, and deployment of steering methods in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRESSing Up LLM: Efficient Stylized Question-Answering via Style Subspace Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14371v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DRESS, a novel approach for generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses through representation editing. Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents.

| **[Movable Antenna Enhanced Integrated Sensing and Communication Via Antenna Position Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07318v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can improve the communication and sensing performance via flexible antenna movement over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. First, we consider the downlink multiuser communication, where each user is randomly distributed within a given three-dimensional zone with local movement. To reduce the overhead of frequent antenna movement, the antenna position vector (APV) is designed based on users' statistical channel state information (CSI), so that the antennas only need to be moved in a large timescale. Then, for target sensing, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the estimation mean square error for different spatial angles of arrival (AoAs) are derived as functions of MAs' positions. Based on the above, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the expected minimum achievable rate among all communication users, with given constraints on the maximum acceptable CRB thresholds for target sensing. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize one of the horizontal and vertical APVs of the MA array with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MA arrays can significantly enlarge the trade-off region between communication and sensing performance compared to conventional FPA arrays with different inter-antenna spacing. It is also revealed that the steering vectors of the designed MA arrays exhibit low correlation in the angular domain, thus effectively reducing channel correlation among communication users to enhance their achievable rates, while alleviating ambiguity in target angle estimation to achieve improved sensing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors for combined steering goals that empirically outperform additively combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs. Our code is available on github.com/jorispos/conceptorsteering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the MINT workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Prior research has shown that a single LLM's concept representations can be captured as steering vectors (SVs), enabling the control of LLM behavior (e.g., towards generating harmful content). Our work takes a novel approach by exploring the intricate relationships between concept representations across different LLMs, drawing an intriguing parallel to Plato's Allegory of the Cave. In particular, we introduce a linear transformation method to bridge these representations and present three key findings: 1) Concept representations across different LLMs can be effectively aligned using simple linear transformations, enabling efficient cross-model transfer and behavioral control via SVs. 2) This linear transformation generalizes across concepts, facilitating alignment and control of SVs representing different concepts across LLMs. 3) A weak-to-strong transferability exists between LLM concept representations, whereby SVs extracted from smaller LLMs can effectively control the behavior of larger LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While with limited microphone arrays, developing a compact multi-channel speech enhancement system remains challenging, especially in extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this issue, we propose a triple-steering spatial selection method, a flexible framework that uses three steering vectors to guide enhancement and determine the enhancement range. Specifically, we introduce a causal-directed U-Net (CDUNet) model, which takes raw multi-channel speech and the desired enhancement width as inputs. This enables dynamic adjustment of steering vectors based on the target direction and fine-tuning of the enhancement region according to the angular separation between the target and interference signals. Our model with only a dual microphone array, excels in both speech quality and downstream task performance. It operates in real-time with minimal parameters, making it ideal for low-latency, on-device streaming applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beam Codebook Refinement for mmWave Devices with Random Orientations: Concept and Experimental Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20726v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in codebook-based beam-steering for millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems due to its potential for low complexity and rapid beam search. A key focus of recent research has been the design of codebooks that strike a trade-off between achievable gain and codebook size, which directly impacts beam search time. Statistical approaches have shown promise by leveraging the likelihood that certain beam directions (equivalently, sets of phase-shifter configurations) are more probable than others. Such approaches are shown to be valid for static, non-rotating transmission stations such as base stations. However, for the case of user terminals that are constantly changing orientation, the possible phase-shifter configurations become equally probable, rendering statistical methods less relevant. On the other hand, user terminals come with a large number of possible steering vector configurations, which can span up to six orders of magnitude. Therefore, efficient solutions to reduce the codebook size (set of possible steering vectors) without compromising array gain are needed. We address this challenge by proposing a novel and practical codebook refinement technique, aiming to reduce the codebook size while maintaining array gain within $\gamma$ dB of the maximum achievable gain at any random orientation of the user terminal. We project that a steering vector at a given angle could effectively cover adjacent angles with a small gain loss compared to the maximum achievable gain. We demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to reduce the codebook size from $1024^{16}$ to just a few configurations (e.g., less than ten), covering all angles while maintaining the gain within $\gamma=3$ dB of the maximum achievable gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.</p></details> |  |

However, recent researches reveal safety-aligned LLMs prone to reject benign queries due to the exaggerated safety issue, limiting their helpfulness. In this paper, we propose a Safety-Conscious Activation Steering (SCANS) method to mitigate the exaggerated safety concerns in aligned LLMs. First, SCANS extracts the refusal steering vectors within the activation space and utilizes vocabulary projection to anchor some specific safety-critical layers which influence model refusal behavior. Second, by tracking the hidden state transition, SCANS identifies the steering direction and steers the model behavior accordingly, achieving a balance between exaggerated safety and adequate safety. Experiments show that SCANS achieves new state-of-the-art performance on XSTest and OKTest benchmarks, without impairing their defense capability against harmful queries and maintaining almost unchanged model capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted to AAAI 2025. 14 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

Existing works primarily treat LLMs' activations as points in space and modify them by adding steering vectors. However, this approach is limited in its ability to achieve greater performance improvement while maintaining the necessary consistency of activation magnitudes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel editing method that views activations in terms of their directions and magnitudes. Our method, named Householder Pseudo-Rotation (HPR), mimics the rotation transformation, thus preserving activation norms and resulting in an improved performance on various safety benchmarks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

Adding steering vectors to the model is a promising method of model control that is easier than finetuning, and may be more robust than prompting. However, it can be difficult to anticipate the effects of steering vectors produced by methods such as CAA [Panickssery et al., 2024] or the direct use of SAE latents [Templeton et al., 2024]. In our work, we address this issue by using SAEs to measure the effects of steering vectors, giving us a method that can be used to understand the causal effect of any steering vector intervention. We use this method for measuring causal effects to develop an improved steering method, SAE-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS), which finds steering vectors to target specific SAE features while minimizing unintended side effects. We show that overall, SAE-TS balances steering effects with coherence better than CAA and SAE feature steering, when evaluated on a range of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 maintext pages and 9 appendix pages</p></details> |

However, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) may offer a potential method to interpret steering vectors, recent findings show that SAE-reconstructed vectors often lack the steering properties of the original vectors. This paper investigates why directly applying SAEs to steering vectors yields misleading decompositions, identifying two reasons: (1) steering vectors fall outside the input distribution for which SAEs are designed, and (2) steering vectors can have meaningful negative projections in feature directions, which SAEs are not designed to accommodate. These limitations hinder the direct use of SAEs for interpreting steering vectors.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, unlearning has emerged as a solution to effectively remove sensitive knowledge from models after training. Yet, recent work has shown that supposedly deleted information can still be extracted by malicious actors through various attacks. Still, current attacks retrieve sets of possible candidate generations and are unable to pinpoint the output that contains the actual target information. We propose activation steering as a method for exact information retrieval from unlearned LLMs. We introduce a novel approach to generating steering vectors, named Anonymized Activation Steering. Additionally, we develop a simple word frequency method to pinpoint the correct answer among a set of candidates when retrieving unlearned information. Our evaluation across multiple unlearning techniques and datasets demonstrates that activation steering successfully recovers general knowledge (e.g., widely known fictional characters) while revealing limitations in retrieving specific information (e.g., details about non-public individuals). Overall, our results demonstrate that exact information retrieval from unlearned models is possible, highlighting a severe vulnerability of current unlearning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024 Workshop Safe Generative AI</p></details> |
| **[Controlling Large Language Model Agents with Entropic Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00244v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has prompted increasing interest in their use as in-context learning agents. At the core of agentic behavior is the capacity for exploration, or the ability to actively gather information about the environment. But how do LLM agents explore, and how can we control their exploratory behaviors? To answer these questions, we take a representation-level perspective, and introduce Entropic Activation Steering (EAST), an activation steering method for in-context LLM agents. Firstly, we demonstrate that EAST can effectively manipulate an LLM agent's exploration by directly affecting the high-level actions parsed from the outputs of the LLM, in contrast to token-level temperature sampling. Secondly, we reveal how applying this control modulates the uncertainty exhibited in the LLM's thoughts, guiding the agent towards more exploratory actions. Finally, we demonstrate that the steering vectors obtained by EAST generalize across task variants. In total, these results show that LLM agents explicitly encode uncertainty over their actions in their representation space. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of the functioning of LLM agents and to effective control of their decision-making behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Language Models With Activation Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248v5)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering and finetuning aim to maximize language model performance on a given metric (like toxicity reduction). However, these methods do not fully elicit a model's capabilities. To reduce this gap, we introduce activation engineering: the inference-time modification of activations in order to control (or steer) model outputs. Specifically, we introduce the Activation Addition (ActAdd) technique, which contrasts the intermediate activations on prompt pairs (such as "Love" versus "Hate") to compute a steering vector (Subramani et al. 2022). By tactically adding in e.g. the "Love" - "Hate" steering vector during the forward pass, we achieve SOTA on negative-to-positive sentiment shift and detoxification using models including LLaMA-3 and OPT. ActAdd yields inference-time control over high-level output properties (like topic and sentiment) while preserving performance on off-target tasks. ActAdd is lightweight: it does not require any machine optimization and works with a single pair of data points, which enables rapid iteration over steering. ActAdd demonstrates the power of activation engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Timeline and Analysis for Representation Plasticity in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06225v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to steer AI behavior is crucial to preventing its long term dangerous and catastrophic potential. Representation Engineering (RepE) has emerged as a novel, powerful method to steer internal model behaviors, such as "honesty", at a top-down level. Understanding the steering of representations should thus be placed at the forefront of alignment initiatives. Unfortunately, current efforts to understand plasticity at this level are highly neglected. This paper aims to bridge the knowledge gap and understand how LLM representation stability, specifically for the concept of "honesty", and model plasticity evolve by applying steering vectors extracted at different fine-tuning stages, revealing differing magnitudes of shifts in model behavior. The findings are pivotal, showing that while early steering exhibits high plasticity, later stages have a surprisingly responsive critical window. This pattern is observed across different model architectures, signaling that there is a general pattern of model plasticity that can be used for effective intervention. These insights greatly contribute to the field of AI transparency, addressing a pressing lack of efficiency limiting our ability to effectively steer model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Scaling for Steering and Interpreting Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04962v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the prompt "Rome is in", can we steer a language model to flip its prediction of an incorrect token "France" to a correct token "Italy" by only multiplying a few relevant activation vectors with scalars? We argue that successfully intervening on a model is a prerequisite for interpreting its internal workings. Concretely, we establish a three-term objective: a successful intervention should flip the correct with the wrong token and vice versa (effectiveness), and leave other tokens unaffected (faithfulness), all while being sparse (minimality). Using gradient-based optimization, this objective lets us learn (and later evaluate) a specific kind of efficient and interpretable intervention: activation scaling only modifies the signed magnitude of activation vectors to strengthen, weaken, or reverse the steering directions already encoded in the model. On synthetic tasks, this intervention performs comparably with steering vectors in terms of effectiveness and faithfulness, but is much more minimal allowing us to pinpoint interpretable model components. We evaluate activation scaling from different angles, compare performance on different datasets, and make activation scalars a learnable function of the activation vectors themselves to generalize to varying-length prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Inference-time Category-wise Safety Steering for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01174v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have seen unprecedented advancements in capabilities and applications across a variety of use-cases, safety alignment of these models is still an area of active research. The fragile nature of LLMs, even models that have undergone extensive alignment and safety training regimes, warrants additional safety steering steps via training-free, inference-time methods. While recent work in the area of mechanistic interpretability has investigated how activations in latent representation spaces may encode concepts, and thereafter performed representation engineering to induce such concepts in LLM outputs, the applicability of such for safety is relatively under-explored. Unlike recent inference-time safety steering works, in this paper we explore safety steering of LLM outputs using: (i) category-specific steering vectors, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the steering, and (ii) sophisticated methods for extracting informative steering vectors for more effective safety steering while retaining quality of the generated text. We demonstrate our exploration on multiple LLMs and datasets, and showcase the effectiveness of the proposed steering method, along with a discussion on the implications and best practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding How CodeLLMs (Mis)Predict Types with Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01903v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CodeLLMs are transforming software development as we know it. This is especially true for tasks where rule-based approaches fall short, like type prediction. The type prediction task consists in adding a new type annotation to a partially typed program, such that the resulting program is closer to being fully typed. The intractability of rule-based approaches and high cost of manual annotation make CodeLLMs an attractive solution to the problem. However, CodeLLMs are still far from being deployed on the large-scale due to doubts surrounding their reliability. To shed some light on how CodeLLMs approach type prediction, we investigate what happens when a model mispredicts a type. We show that by applying semantics-preserving edits to code, CodeLLMs are eventually misled into mispredicting type annotations. However, by leveraging activation steering we are able to "steer" the model back to the correct prediction, making models more robust against semantically irrelevant prompt features. We show that steering achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning directly on the type prediction task. Furthermore, we find that steering vectors computed from Python code are effective at correcting TypeScript mispredictions, and vice versa. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of its kind to suggest that CodeLLMs learn task representations that transfer across languages.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards Tracing Trustworthiness Dynamics: Revisiting Pre-training Period of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19465v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. Most studies concentrate on fully pre-trained LLMs to better understand and improve LLMs' trustworthiness. In this paper, to reveal the untapped potential of pre-training, we pioneer the exploration of LLMs' trustworthiness during this period, focusing on five key dimensions: reliability, privacy, toxicity, fairness, and robustness. To begin with, we apply linear probing to LLMs. The high probing accuracy suggests that \textit{LLMs in early pre-training can already distinguish concepts in each trustworthiness dimension}. Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM's pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM's trustworthiness. Finally, inspired by~\citet{choi2023understanding} that mutual information estimation is bounded by linear probing accuracy, we also probe LLMs with mutual information to investigate the dynamics of trustworthiness during pre-training. We are the first to observe a similar two-phase phenomenon: fitting and compression~\citep{shwartz2017opening}. This research provides an initial exploration of trustworthiness modeling during LLM pre-training, seeking to unveil new insights and spur further developments in the field. We will make our code publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/ChnQ/TracingLLM}.</p></details> | Accepted at ACL 2024 |
| **[Trojan Activation Attack: Red-Teaming Large Language Models using Activation Steering for Safety-Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09433v3)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure AI safety, instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are specifically trained to ensure alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with human intentions. While these models have demonstrated commendable results on various safety benchmarks, the vulnerability of their safety alignment has not been extensively studied. This is particularly troubling given the potential harm that LLMs can inflict. Existing attack methods on LLMs often rely on poisoned training data or the injection of malicious prompts. These approaches compromise the stealthiness and generalizability of the attacks, making them susceptible to detection. Additionally, these models often demand substantial computational resources for implementation, making them less practical for real-world applications. In this work, we study a different attack scenario, called Trojan Activation Attack (TA^2), which injects trojan steering vectors into the activation layers of LLMs. These malicious steering vectors can be triggered at inference time to steer the models toward attacker-desired behaviors by manipulating their activations. Our experiment results on four primary alignment tasks show that TA^2 is highly effective and adds little or no overhead to attack efficiency. Additionally, we discuss potential countermeasures against such activation attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM I...</summary><p>ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM'24)</p></details> |

User personas and the mechanics of latent misalignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12094v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite investments in improving model safety, studies show that misaligned capabilities remain latent in safety-tuned models. In this work, we shed light on the mechanics of this phenomenon. First, we show that even when model generations are safe, harmful content can persist in hidden representations and can be extracted by decoding from earlier layers. Then, we show that whether the model divulges such content depends significantly on its perception of who it is talking to, which we refer to as user persona. In fact, we find manipulating user persona to be even more effective for eliciting harmful content than direct attempts to control model refusal. We study both natural language prompting and activation steering as control methods and show that activation steering is significantly more effective at bypassing safety filters. We investigate why certain personas break model safeguards and find that they enable the model to form more charitable interpretations of otherwise dangerous queries. Finally, we show we can predict a persona's effect on refusal given only the geometry of its steering vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Steering of Large Language Models: Versatile Steering Vectors Through Bi-directional Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00045v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have been studying approaches to steer the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and build personalized LLMs tailored for various applications. While fine-tuning seems to be a direct solution, it requires substantial computational resources and may significantly affect the utility of the original LLM. Recent endeavors have introduced more lightweight strategies, focusing on extracting "steering vectors" to guide the model's output toward desired behaviors by adjusting activations within specific layers of the LLM's transformer architecture. However, such steering vectors are directly extracted from the activations of human preference data and thus often lead to suboptimal results and occasional failures, especially in alignment-related scenarios. This work proposes an innovative approach that could produce more effective steering vectors through bi-directional preference optimization. Our method is designed to allow steering vectors to directly influence the generation probability of contrastive human preference data pairs, thereby offering a more precise representation of the target behavior. By carefully adjusting the direction and magnitude of the steering vector, we enabled personalized control over the desired behavior across a spectrum of intensities. Extensive experimentation across various open-ended generation tasks, particularly focusing on steering AI personas, has validated the efficacy of our approach. Moreover, we comprehensively investigate critical alignment-concerning scenarios, such as managing truthfulness, mitigating hallucination, and addressing jailbreaking attacks. Remarkably, our method can still demonstrate outstanding steering effectiveness across these scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase the transferability of our steering vectors across different models/LoRAs and highlight the synergistic benefits of applying multiple vectors simultaneously.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03658v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Informally, the 'linear representation hypothesis' is the idea that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in some representation space. In this paper, we address two closely related questions: What does "linear representation" actually mean? And, how do we make sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similarity or projection) in the representation space? To answer these, we use the language of counterfactuals to give two formalizations of "linear representation", one in the output (word) representation space, and one in the input (sentence) space. We then prove these connect to linear probing and model steering, respectively. To make sense of geometric notions, we use the formalization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean) inner product that respects language structure in a sense we make precise. Using this causal inner product, we show how to unify all notions of linear representation. In particular, this allows the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations of concepts, the connection to interpretation and control, and the fundamental role of the choice of inner product.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for a presentation at ICML 2024 and an oral presentation at NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Causal Representation Learning.

| **[Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681v4)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), an innovative method for steering language models by modifying their activations during forward passes. CAA computes "steering vectors" by averaging the difference in residual stream activations between pairs of positive and negative examples of a particular behavior, such as factual versus hallucinatory responses. During inference, these steering vectors are added at all token positions after the user's prompt with either a positive or negative coefficient, allowing precise control over the degree of the targeted behavior. We evaluate CAA's effectiveness on Llama 2 Chat using multiple-choice behavioral question datasets and open-ended generation tasks. We demonstrate that CAA significantly alters model behavior, is effective over and on top of traditional methods like finetuning and system prompt design, and minimally reduces capabilities. Moreover, we gain deeper insights into CAA's mechanisms by employing various activation space interpretation methods. CAA accurately steers model outputs and sheds light on how high-level concepts are represented in Large Language Models (LLMs).</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Without Side Effects: Improving Post-Deployment Control of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15518v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) have been shown to behave unexpectedly post-deployment. For example, new jailbreaks continually arise, allowing model misuse, despite extensive red-teaming and adversarial training from developers. Given most model queries are unproblematic and frequent retraining results in unstable user experience, methods for mitigation of worst-case behavior should be targeted. One such method is classifying inputs as potentially problematic, then selectively applying steering vectors on these problematic inputs, i.e. adding particular vectors to model hidden states. However, steering vectors can also negatively affect model performance, which will be an issue on cases where the classifier was incorrect. We present KL-then-steer (KTS), a technique that decreases the side effects of steering while retaining its benefits, by first training a model to minimize Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a steered and unsteered model on benign inputs, then steering the model that has undergone this training. Our best method prevents 44% of jailbreak attacks compared to the original Llama-2-chat-7B model while maintaining helpfulness (as measured by MT-Bench) on benign requests almost on par with the original LM. To demonstrate the generality and transferability of our method beyond jailbreaks, we show that our KTS model can be steered to reduce bias towards user-suggested answers on TruthfulQA.

| **[Near-Field Multiuser Communications based on Sparse Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09238v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers near-field multiuser communications based on sparse arrays (SAs). First, for the uniform SAs (USAs), we analyze the beam gains of channel steering vectors, which shows that increasing the antenna spacings can effectively improve the spatial resolution of the antenna arrays to enhance the sum rate of multiuser communications. Then, we investigate nonuniform SAs (NSAs) to mitigate the high multiuser interference from the grating lobes of the USAs. To maximize the sum rate of near-field multiuser communications, we optimize the antenna positions of the NSAs, where a successive convex approximation-based antenna position optimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, we find that the channels of both the USAs and the NSAs show uniform sparsity in the defined surrogate distance-angle (SD-A) domain. Based on the channel sparsity, an on-grid SD-A-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (SDA-OMP) algorithm is developed to estimate multiuser channels. To further improve the resolution of the SDA-OMP, we also design an off-grid SD-A-domain iterative super-resolution channel estimation algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holographic MIMO Systems, Their Channel Estimation and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17114v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems constitute a promising technology in support of next-generation wireless communications, thus paving the way for a smart programmable radio environment. However, despite its significant potential, further fundamental issues remain to be addressed, such as the acquisition of accurate channel information. Indeed, the conventional angular-domain channel representation is no longer adequate for characterizing the sparsity inherent in holographic MIMO channels. To fill this knowledge gap, in this article, we conceive a decomposition and reconstruction (DeRe)-based framework for facilitating the estimation of sparse channels in holographic MIMOs. In particular, the channel parameters involved in the steering vector, namely the azimuth and elevation angles plus the distance (AED), are decomposed for independently constructing their own covariance matrices. Then, the acquisition of each parameter can be formulated as a compressive sensing (CS) problem by harnessing the covariance matrix associated with each individual parameter. We demonstrate that our solution exhibits an improved performance and imposes a reduced pilot overhead, despite its reduced complexity. Finally, promising open research topics are highlighted to bridge the gap between the theory and the practical employment of holographic MIMO schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE VTM</p></details> |

Activation steering techniques can be used to reduce risks from these capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of activation steering for broad skills and multiple behaviours. First, by comparing the effects of reducing performance on general coding ability and Python-specific ability, we find that steering broader skills is competitive to steering narrower skills. Second, we steer models to become more or less myopic and wealth-seeking, among other behaviours. In our experiments, combining steering vectors for multiple different behaviours into one steering vector is largely unsuccessful. On the other hand, injecting individual steering vectors at different places in a model simultaneously is promising.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/TeunvdWeij/extending-activation-addition</p></details> |

This task plays a pivotal role in reducing the resource-intensive measurements required for precise sound source separation and localization, essential as the front-end of speech recognition. Classical approaches to interpolation rely on linear weighting of nearby measurements in space on a fixed, discrete set of frequencies. Drawing inspiration from the success of neural fields for novel view synthesis in computer vision, we introduce the neural steerer, a continuous complex-valued function that takes both frequency and direction as input and produces the corresponding steering vector. Importantly, it incorporates inter-channel phase difference information and a regularization term enforcing filter causality, essential for accurate steering vector modeling. Our experiments, conducted using a dataset of real measured steering vectors, demonstrate the effectiveness of our resolution-free model in interpolating such measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version for HSCMA 24 at ICASSP 24</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Bias Representations in Llama 2 Chat via Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00402v1)** | 2024-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of societal bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on the Llama 2 7B Chat model. As LLMs are increasingly integrated into decision-making processes with substantial societal impact, it becomes imperative to ensure these models do not reinforce existing biases. Our approach employs activation steering to probe for and mitigate biases related to gender, race, and religion. This method manipulates model activations to direct responses towards or away from biased outputs, utilizing steering vectors derived from the StereoSet dataset and custom GPT4 generated gender bias prompts. Our findings reveal inherent gender bias in Llama 2 7B Chat, persisting even after Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We also observe a predictable negative correlation between bias and the model's tendency to refuse responses. Significantly, our study uncovers that RLHF tends to increase the similarity in the model's representation of different forms of societal biases, which raises questions about the model's nuanced understanding of different forms of bias. This work also provides valuable insights into effective red-teaming strategies for LLMs using activation steering, particularly emphasizing the importance of integrating a refusal vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[InferAligner: Inference-Time Alignment for Harmlessness through Cross-Model Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11206v1)** | 2024-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they are not only used as general-purpose AI assistants but are also customized through further fine-tuning to meet the requirements of different applications. A pivotal factor in the success of current LLMs is the alignment process. Current alignment methods, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focus on training-time alignment and are often complex and cumbersome to implement. Therefore, we develop \textbf{InferAligner}, a novel inference-time alignment method that utilizes cross-model guidance for harmlessness alignment. InferAligner utilizes safety steering vectors extracted from safety-aligned model to modify the activations of the target model when responding to harmful inputs, thereby guiding the target model to provide harmless responses. Experimental results show that our method can be very effectively applied to domain-specific models in finance, medicine, and mathematics, as well as to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as LLaVA. It significantly diminishes the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of both harmful instructions and jailbreak attacks, while maintaining almost unchanged performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

By considering both the near field and far field, a triple-refined hybrid-field beam training scheme is proposed, where high-accuracy estimates of channel parameters are obtained through three steps of progressive beam refinement. First, the hybrid-field beam gain (HFBG)-based first refinement method is developed. Based on the analysis of the HFBG, the first-refinement codebook is designed and the beam training is performed accordingly to narrow down the potential region of the channel path. Then, the maximum likelihood (ML)-based and principle of stationary phase (PSP)-based second refinement methods are developed. By exploiting the measurements of the beam training, the ML is used to estimate the channel parameters. To avoid the high computational complexity of ML, closed-form estimates of the channel parameters are derived according to the PSP. Moreover, the Gaussian approximation (GA)-based third refinement method is developed. The hybrid-field neighboring search is first performed to identify the potential region of the main lobe of the channel steering vector. Afterwards, by applying the GA, a least-squares estimator is developed to obtain the high-accuracy channel parameter estimation. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

By modeling the target speech as a non-stationary Laplacian distribution, a mask-based statistical beamforming algorithm is proposed to exploit both its output and masked input variance for robust estimation of the beamformer. In addition, we also present a method for steering vector estimation (SVE) based on a noise power ratio obtained from the target and noise outputs in independent component analysis (ICA). To update the beamformer in the same ICA framework, we derive ICA with distortionless and null constraints on target speech, which yields beamformed speech at the target output and noises at the other outputs, respectively. The demixing weights for the target output result in a statistical beamformer with the weighted spatial covariance matrix (wSCM) using a weighting function characterized by a source model. To enhance the SVE, the strict null constraints imposed by the Lagrange multiplier methods are relaxed by generalized penalties with weight parameters, while the strict distortionless constraints are maintained. Furthermore, we derive an online algorithm based on an optimization technique of recursive least squares (RLS) for practical applications. Experimental results on various environments using CHiME-4 and LibriCSS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm compared to conventional beamforming and blind source extraction (BSE) based on ICA on both batch and online processing.</p></details> | Accepted by TASLP |
| **[Improving Activation Steering in Language Models with Mean-Centring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03813v1)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in activation steering has demonstrated the potential to better control the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it involves finding steering vectors. This is difficult because engineers do not typically know how features are represented in these models. We seek to address this issue by applying the idea of mean-centring to steering vectors. We find that taking the average of activations associated with a target dataset, and then subtracting the mean of all training activations, results in effective steering vectors. We test this method on a variety of models on natural language tasks by steering away from generating toxic text, and steering the completion of a story towards a target genre. We also apply mean-centring to extract function vectors, more effectively triggering the execution of a range of natural language tasks by a significant margin (compared to previous baselines). This suggests that mean-centring can be used to easily improve the effectiveness of activation steering in a wide range of contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beam Training and Tracking for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15066v1)** | 2023-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, beam training and beam tracking are investigated for extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output communication systems with partially-connected hybrid combining structures. Firstly, we propose a two-stage hybrid-field beam training scheme for both the near field and the far field. In the first stage, each subarray independently uses multiple far-field channel steering vectors to approximate near-field ones for analog combining. To find the codeword best fitting for the channel, digital combiners in the second stage are designed to combine the outputs of the analog combiners from the first stage. Then, based on the principle of stationary phase and the time-frequency duality, the expressions of subarray signals after analog combining are analytically derived and a beam refinement based on phase shifts of subarrays~(BRPSS) scheme with closed-form solutions is proposed for high-resolution channel parameter estimation. Moreover, a low-complexity near-field beam tracking scheme is developed, where the kinematic model is adopted to characterize the channel variations and the extended Kalman filter is exploited for beam tracking. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.</p></details> |  |

Many methods developed for this task, including the direct path dominance (DPD) test, share common stages in their processing, which include transformation using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and a direction of arrival (DOA) search that is based on the head related transfer function (HRTF) set. In this paper, alternatives to these processing stages, motivated by human hearing, are proposed. These include incorporating an auditory filter bank to replace the STFT, and a new DOA search based on transformed HRTF as steering vectors. A simulation study and an experimental study are conducted to validate the proposed alternatives, and both are applied to two binaural DOA estimation methods; the results show that the proposed method compares favorably with current methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we devise an efficient RAB technique for dealing with covariance matrix reconstruction issues. The proposed method involves INC matrix reconstruction using an idea in which the power and the steering vector of the interferences are estimated based on the power method. Furthermore, spatial match processing is computed to reconstruct the desired signal-plus-noise covariance matrix. Then, the noise components are excluded to retain the desired signal (DS) covariance matrix. A key feature of the proposed technique is to avoid eigenvalue decomposition of the INC matrix to obtain the dominant power of the interference-plus-noise region. Moreover, the INC reconstruction is carried out according to the definition of the theoretical INC matrix. Simulation results are shown and discussed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against existing approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[MUSIC Algorithm for IRS-Assisted AOA Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02947v1)** | 2023-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Based on the signals received across its antennas, a multi-antenna base station (BS) can apply the classic multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for estimating the angle of arrivals (AOAs) of its incident signals. This method can be leveraged to localize the users if their line-of-sight (LOS) paths to the BS are available. In this paper, we consider a more challenging AOA estimation setup in the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where LOS paths do not exist between the BS and the users, while the users' signals can be transmitted to the BS merely via their LOS paths to the IRS as well as the LOS path from the IRS to the BS. Specifically, we treat the IRS as the anchor and are interested in estimating the AOAs of the incident signals from the users to the IRS. Note that we have to achieve the above goal based on the signals received by the BS, because the passive IRS cannot process its received signals. However, the signals received across different antennas of the BS only contain AOA information of its incident signals via the LOS path from the IRS to the BS. To tackle this challenge arising from the spatial-domain received signals, we propose an innovative approach to create temporal-domain multi-dimension received signals for estimating the AOAs of the paths from the users to the IRS. Specifically, via a proper design of the user message pattern and the IRS reflecting pattern, we manage to show that our designed temporal-domain multi-dimension signals can be surprisingly expressed as a function of the virtual steering vectors of the IRS towards the users. This amazing result implies that the classic MUSIC algorithm can be applied to our designed temporal-domain multi-dimension signals for accurately estimating the AOAs of the signals from the users to the IRS.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE VTC 2023-Fall</p></details> |

The proposed CMR-ISPS approach reconstructs the interference-plus-noise covariance (INC) matrix based on a simplified maximum entropy power spectral density function that can be used to shape the directional response of the beamformer. Firstly, we estimate the directions of arrival (DoAs) of the interfering sources with the available snapshots. We then develop an algorithm to reconstruct the INC matrix using a weighted sum of outer products of steering vectors whose coefficients can be estimated in the vicinity of the DoAs of the interferences which lie in a small angular sector. We also devise a cost-effective adaptive algorithm based on conjugate gradient techniques to update the beamforming weights and a method to obtain estimates of the signal of interest (SOI) steering vector from the spatial power spectrum. The proposed CMR-ISPS beamformer can suppress interferers close to the direction of the SOI by producing notches in the directional response of the array with sufficient depths. Simulation results are provided to confirm the validity of the proposed method and make a comparison to existing approaches</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

For the first time, we derive a general interference signal model that fully accounts for not only the time-frequency incoherence, e.g., different FMCW configuration parameters and time offsets, but also the slow-time code MIMO incoherence and array configuration differences between the victim and interfering radars. Along with a standard MIMO-FMCW object signal model, we turn the interference mitigation into a spatial-domain object detection under incoherent MIMO-FMCW interference described by the explicit interference signal model, and propose a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector. More specifically, the proposed detector exploits the structural property of the derived interference model at both \emph{transmit} and \emph{receive} steering vector space. We also derive analytical closed-form expressions for probabilities of detection and false alarm. Performance evaluation using both synthetic-level and phased array system-level simulation confirms the effectiveness of our proposed detector over selected baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures;</p></details> |

However, their localization accuracy is still far from satisfactory due to the vulnerability to nonspeech interference. To improve the robustness against interference, we propose a DNN based normalized time-frequency (T-F) weighted criterion which minimizes the distance between the candidate steering vectors and the filtered snapshots in the T-F domain. Our method requires no eigendecomposition and uses a simple normalization to prevent the optimization objective from being misled by noisy filtered snapshots. We also study different designs of T-F weights guided by a DNN. We find that duplicating the Hadamard product of speech ratio masks is highly effective and better than other techniques such as direct masking and taking the mean in the proposed approach. However, the best-performing design of T-F weights is criterion-dependent in general. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms popular DNN based DoA estimation methods including widely used subspace methods in noisy and reverberant environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages.

Nevertheless, THz-band transmission faces several unique challenges, one of which is beam-split which occurs due to the usage of subcarrier-independent analog beamformers and causes the generated beams at different subcarriers split, and point to different directions. Unlike the prior works dealing with beam-split by employing additional complex hardware components, e.g., time-delayer networks, a beam-split-aware orthogonal matching pursuit (BSA-OMP) approach is introduced to efficiently estimate the THz channel and beamformer design without any additional hardware. Specifically, we design a BSA dictionary comprised of beam-split-corrected steering vectors which inherently include the effect of beam-split so that the proposed BSA-OMP solution automatically yields the beam-split-corrected physical channel directions. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of BSA-OMP approach against the existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Paper in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |

A new formulation of the volumetric array directivity problem is proposed using the rectangular coordinates to describe each antenna element and the desired azimuth and elevation angles with a general element pattern. Such a directivity problem is formulated to find the optimal minimum distance between the antenna elements $d_\text{min}$ aiming to achieve as high directivity gains as possible. {An expedited implementation method is developed to place the antenna elements in a distinctive plane dependent on ($\theta_0$; $\phi_0$). A novel concept on optimizing directivity for the uniform planar array (OUPA) is introduced to find a quasi-optimal solution for the non-convex optimization problem with low complexity. This solution is reached by deploying the proposed successive evaluation and validation (SEV) method. {Moreover, the genetic} algorithm (GA) method was deployed to find the directivity optimization solution expeditiously. For a small number of antenna elements {, typically $N\in [4,\dots, 9]$,} the achievable directivity by GA optimization demonstrates gains of $\sim 3$ dBi compared with the traditional beamforming technique, using steering vector for uniform linear arrays (ULA) and uniform circular arrays (UCA), while gains of $\sim1.5$ dBi are attained when compared with an improved UCA directivity method. For a larger number of antenna elements {, two improved GA procedures, namely GA-{\it marginal} and GA-{\it stall}, were} proposed and compared with the OUPA method. OUPA also indicates promising directivity gains surpassing $30$ dBi for massive MIMO scenarios.</p></details> | 25pages |

In the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, the proposed network processes each frequency independently, and all frequencies use a shared network. For each frequency, the network performs end-to-end speech separation, namely taking as input the STFT coefficients of microphone signals, and predicting the separated STFT coefficients of multiple speakers. The proposed network learns to cluster the frame-wise spatial/steering vectors that belong to different speakers. It is mainly composed of three components. First, a self-attention network. Clustering of spatial vectors shares a similar principle with the self-attention mechanism in the sense of computing the similarity of vectors and then aggregating similar vectors. Second, a convolutional feed-forward network. The convolutional layers are employed for signal smoothing and reverberation processing. Third, a novel hidden-layer normalization method, i.e. group batch normalization (GBN), is especially designed for the proposed narrow-band network to maintain the distribution of hidden units over frequencies. Overall, the proposed network is named NBC2, as it is a revised version of our previous NBC (narrow-band conformer) network. Experiments show that 1) the proposed network outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, 2) the proposed GBN improves the signal-to-distortion ratio by 3 dB, relative to other normalization methods, such as batch/layer/group normalization, 3) the proposed narrow-band network is spectrum-agnostic, as it does not learn spectral patterns, and 4) the proposed network is indeed performing frame clustering (demonstrated by the attention maps).</p></details> | submitted to TASLP |

We first introduce the concept of triple beams (TBs) in the space-frequency-time (SFT) domain and establish a TB based channel model using sampled triple steering vectors. With the established channel model, we then investigate the optimal channel estimation and pilot design for pilot segments. Specifically, we find the conditions that allow pilot reuse among multiple user terminals (UTs), which significantly reduces pilot overhead and increases the number of UTs that can be served. Moreover, we propose a channel prediction method for data segments based on the estimated TB domain channel. To reduce the complexity, we formulate the channel estimation as a statistical inference problem and then obtain the channel by the proposed constrained Bethe free energy minimization (CBFEM) based channel estimation algorithm, which can be implemented with low complexity by exploiting the structure of the TB matrix together with the chirp z-transform (CZT). Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed channel acquisition approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[A Penalized Inequality-Constrained Approach for Robust Beamforming with DoF Limitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03365v3)** | 2022-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A well-known challenge in beamforming is how to optimally utilize the degrees of freedom (DoF) of the array to design a robust beamformer, especially when the array DoF is limited. In this paper, we leverage the tool of constrained convex optimization and propose a penalized inequality-constrained minimum variance (P-ICMV) beamformer to address this challenge. Specifically, a well-targeted objective function and inequality constraints are proposed to achieve the design goals. By penalizing the maximum gain of the beamformer at any interfering directions, the total interference power can be efficiently mitigated with limited DoF. Multiple robust constraints on the target protection and interference suppression can be introduced to increase the robustness of the beamformer against steering vector mismatch. By integrating the noise reduction, interference suppression, and target protection, the proposed formulation can efficiently obtain a robust beamformer design while optimally trading off various design goals. To numerically solve this problem, we formulate the P-ICMV beamformer design as a convex second-order cone program (SOCP) and propose a low complexity iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Three applications are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[Robust Linear Precoder Design for 3D Massive MIMO Downlink with A Posteriori Channel Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04331v2)** | 2022-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the robust linear precoder design for three dimensional (3D) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) downlink with uniform planar array (UPA) and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In practical massive MIMO with UPAs, the number of antennas in each column or row is usually limited. The straightforward extension of the conventional DFT based beam domain channel model widely used in massive MIMO with uniform linear arrays (ULAs) can not apply. To overcome this issue, we establish a new beam domain channel model by using sampled steering vectors. Then, a novel method to obtain the beam domain channel power matrices and the instantaneous beam domain channel coefficients is proposed, and an a posteriori beam domain channel model which includes the channel aging and the spatial correlation is established. On the basis of the a posteriori channel model, we consider the robust precoder design with the expected weighted sum-rate maximization under a total power constraint. By viewing the power constraint as a Riemannian manifold, we transform the constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization problem on the Riemannian manifold. Then, we derive an iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal precoders by setting the Riemannian gradient of the objective function to zero. Furthermore, we propose a low complexity robust precoder design by replacing the expected rates in the objective function with their upper bounds. Simulation results show that the proposed precoders can achieve significant performance gain than the widely used regularized zero forcing (RZF) precoder and signal to leakage noise ratio (SLNR) precoder.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

| **[Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Various-Grained Low-Rank Projection of Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01744v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building upon the success of low-rank adapter (LoRA), low-rank gradient projection (LoRP) has emerged as a promising solution for memory-efficient fine-tuning. However, existing LoRP methods typically treat each row of the gradient matrix as the default projection unit, leaving the role of projection granularity underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel framework, VLoRP, that extends low-rank gradient projection by introducing an additional degree of freedom for controlling the trade-off between memory efficiency and performance, beyond the rank hyper-parameter. Through this framework, we systematically explore the impact of projection granularity, demonstrating that finer-grained projections lead to enhanced stability and efficiency even under a fixed memory budget. Regarding the optimization for VLoRP, we present ProjFactor, an adaptive memory-efficient optimizer, that significantly reduces memory requirement while ensuring competitive performance, even in the presence of gradient accumulation. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis of VLoRP, demonstrating the descent and convergence of its optimization trajectory under both SGD and ProjFactor. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our findings, covering tasks such as commonsense reasoning, MMLU, and GSM8K.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network-aided Efficient LLM Services With Denoising-inspired Prompt Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03621v3)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, leading to their increasing adoption in diverse services delivered through wireless networks. There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs but also require more computing resources and processing time, which impacts overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information, further enhancing the framework's performance. Experimental results with long prompt tokens demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, significantly reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |
| **[QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04532v3)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

| **[Ascendra: Dynamic Request Prioritization for Efficient LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20828v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for more efficient serving strategies. In this context, efficiency refers to the proportion of requests that meet their Service Level Objectives (SLOs), particularly for Time To First Token (TTFT) and Time Between Tokens (TBT). However, existing systems often prioritize one metric at the cost of the other. We present Ascendra, an LLM serving system designed to meet both TTFT and TBT SLOs simultaneously. The core insight behind Ascendra is that a request's urgency evolves as it approaches its deadline. To leverage this, Ascendra partitions GPU resources into two types of instances: low-priority and high-priority. Low-priority instances maximize throughput by processing requests out of arrival order, but at the risk of request starvation. To address this, Ascendra employs a performance model to predict requests at risk of missing their SLOs and proactively offloads them to high-priority instances. High-priority instances are optimized for low-latency execution and handle urgent requests nearing their deadlines. This partitioned architecture enables Ascendra to effectively balance high throughput and low latency. Extensive evaluation shows that Ascendra improves system throughput by up to 1.7x compared to vLLM and Sarathi-Serve while meeting both TTFT and TBT SLOs.</p></details> |  |

In particular, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced cognitive tasks, often matching or even surpassing human-level performance. However, their extensive parameters result in high computational costs and slow inference, posing challenges for deployment in resource-limited settings. Among the strategies to overcome the aforementioned challenges, pruning emerges as a successful mechanism since it reduces model size while maintaining predictive ability. In this paper, we introduce AMP: Attention Heads and MLP Pruning, a novel structured pruning method that efficiently compresses LLMs by removing less critical structures within Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). By projecting the input data onto weights, AMP assesses structural importance and overcomes the limitations of existing techniques, which often fall short in flexibility or efficiency. In particular, AMP surpasses the current state-of-the-art on commonsense reasoning tasks by up to 1.49 percentage points, achieving a 30% pruning ratio with minimal impact on zero-shot task performance. Moreover, AMP also improves inference speeds, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments. We confirm the flexibility of AMP on different families of LLMs, including LLaMA and Phi.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: Inversion Learning for Highly Effective NLG Evaluation Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21117v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems is challenging due to the diversity of valid outputs. While human evaluation is the gold standard, it suffers from inconsistencies, lack of standardisation, and demographic biases, limiting reproducibility. LLM-based evaluation offers a scalable alternative but is highly sensitive to prompt design, where small variations can lead to significant discrepancies. In this work, we propose an inversion learning method that learns effective reverse mappings from model outputs back to their input instructions, enabling the automatic generation of highly effective, model-specific evaluation prompts. Our method requires only a single evaluation sample and eliminates the need for time-consuming manual prompt engineering, thereby improving both efficiency and robustness. Our work contributes toward a new direction for more robust and efficient LLM-based evaluation.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[semi-PD: Towards Efficient LLM Serving via Phase-Wise Disaggregated Computation and Unified Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19867v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large language model (LLM) serving systems fall into two categories: 1) a unified system where prefill phase and decode phase are co-located on the same GPU, sharing the unified computational resource and storage, and 2) a disaggregated system where the two phases are disaggregated to different GPUs. The design of the disaggregated system addresses the latency interference and sophisticated scheduling issues in the unified system but leads to storage challenges including 1) replicated weights for both phases that prevent flexible deployment, 2) KV cache transfer overhead between the two phases, 3) storage imbalance that causes substantial wasted space of the GPU capacity, and 4) suboptimal resource adjustment arising from the difficulties in migrating KV cache. Such storage inefficiency delivers poor serving performance under high request rates. In this paper, we identify that the advantage of the disaggregated system lies in the disaggregated computation, i.e., partitioning the computational resource to enable the asynchronous computation of two phases. Thus, we propose a novel LLM serving system, semi-PD, characterized by disaggregated computation and unified storage. In semi-PD, we introduce a computation resource controller to achieve disaggregated computation at the streaming multi-processor (SM) level, and a unified memory manager to manage the asynchronous memory access from both phases. semi-PD has a low-overhead resource adjustment mechanism between the two phases, and a service-level objective (SLO) aware dynamic partitioning algorithm to optimize the SLO attainment. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, semi-PD maintains lower latency at higher request rates, reducing the average end-to-end latency per request by 1.27-2.58x on DeepSeek series models, and serves 1.55-1.72x more requests adhering to latency constraints on Llama series models.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Activation sparsity offers a promising solution to reduce computation and memory movement, enabling more efficient inference, particularly for small-batch on-device applications. However, current approaches face limitations with non-ReLU activation function, which are foundational to most advanced LLMs, or require heavy continual training. Additionally, the difficulty in predicting active channels and limited achievable sparsity ratios constrain the effectiveness of activation sparsity-based methods. In this paper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach capable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two preliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the output within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the non-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias terms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an appropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building on this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse inference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular value components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the output sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models across ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable performance at 50% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43% end-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses this issue by dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conversations. Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that leverages graph-based memory representations to capture complex relational structures among conversational elements. Through comprehensive evaluations on LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six baseline categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context approach that processes the entire conversation history, (iv) an open-source memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory management platform. Empirical results show that our methods consistently outperform all existing memory systems across four question categories: single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. Notably, Mem0 achieves 26% relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base configuration. Beyond accuracy gains, we also markedly reduce computational overhead compared to full-context method. In particular, Mem0 attains a 91% lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, offering a compelling balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment constraints. Our findings highlight critical role of structured, persistent memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving the way for more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[BitMoD: Bit-serial Mixture-of-Datatype LLM Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11745v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various machine learning tasks. Yet the substantial memory footprint of LLMs significantly hinders their deployment. In this paper, we improve the accessibility of LLMs through BitMoD, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that enables efficient LLM acceleration at low weight precision. On the algorithm side, BitMoD introduces fine-grained data type adaptation that uses a different numerical data type to quantize a group of (e.g., 128) weights. Through the careful design of these new data types, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to very low precision (e.g., 4 bits and 3 bits) while maintaining high accuracy. On the hardware side, BitMoD employs a bit-serial processing element to easily support multiple numerical precisions and data types; our hardware design includes two key innovations: First, it employs a unified representation to process different weight data types, thus reducing the hardware cost. Second, it adopts a bit-serial dequantization unit to rescale the per-group partial sum with minimal hardware overhead. Our evaluation on six representative LLMs demonstrates that BitMoD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM quantization and acceleration methods. For discriminative tasks, BitMoD can quantize LLM weights to 4-bit with $<\!0.5\%$ accuracy loss on average. For generative tasks, BitMoD is able to quantize LLM weights to 3-bit while achieving better perplexity than prior LLM quantization scheme. Combining the superior model performance with an efficient accelerator design, BitMoD achieves an average of $1.69\times$ and $1.48\times$ speedups compared to prior LLM accelerators ANT and OliVe, respectively.</p></details> | HPCA 2025 |
| **[QuaDMix: Quality-Diversity Balanced Data Selection for Efficient LLM Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16511v2)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality and diversity are two critical metrics for the training data of large language models (LLMs), positively impacting performance. Existing studies often optimize these metrics separately, typically by first applying quality filtering and then adjusting data proportions. However, these approaches overlook the inherent trade-off between quality and diversity, necessitating their joint consideration. Given a fixed training quota, it is essential to evaluate both the quality of each data point and its complementary effect on the overall dataset. In this paper, we introduce a unified data selection framework called QuaDMix, which automatically optimizes the data distribution for LLM pretraining while balancing both quality and diversity. Specifically, we first propose multiple criteria to measure data quality and employ domain classification to distinguish data points, thereby measuring overall diversity. QuaDMix then employs a unified parameterized data sampling function that determines the sampling probability of each data point based on these quality and diversity related labels. To accelerate the search for the optimal parameters involved in the QuaDMix framework, we conduct simulated experiments on smaller models and use LightGBM for parameters searching, inspired by the RegMix method. Our experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that QuaDMix achieves an average performance improvement of 7.2% across multiple benchmarks. These results outperform the independent strategies for quality and diversity, highlighting the necessity and ability to balance data quality and diversity.</p></details> |  |

This mismatch frequently leads to inefficient use of computational resources. For example, in cloud-based services, streaming content faster than users can read appears unnecessary, resulting in wasted computational resources and potential delays for other users, particularly during peak usage periods. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive streaming method that dynamically adjusts the pacing of LLM streaming output in real-time based on inferred cognitive load. Our approach estimates the cognitive load associated with streaming content and strategically slows down the stream during complex or information-rich segments, thereby freeing computational resources for other users. Our statistical analysis of computational savings, combined with crowdsourced user studies, provides insights into the trade-offs between service efficiency and user satisfaction, demonstrating that our method can significantly reduce computational consumption up to 16.8\%. This context-aware computational resource management strategy presents a practical framework for enhancing system efficiency in cloud-based conversational AI interfaces without compromising user experience.</p></details> |  |

While significant efforts have focused on system-level engineering, little is explored from a mathematical modeling and queuing perspective. In this paper, we aim to develop the queuing fundamentals for large language model (LLM) inference, bridging the gap between the queueing theory and LLM system communities. In particular, we study the throughput aspect in LLM inference systems. We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for individual inference LLM engine, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. In a network of LLM agents, work-conserving scheduling alone is insufficient, particularly when facing specific workload structures and multi-class workflows that require more sophisticated scheduling strategies. Evaluations of real-world systems show that Orca and Sarathi-serve are throughput-optimal, reassuring practitioners, while FasterTransformer and vanilla vLLM are not maximally stable and should be used with caution. Our results highlight the substantial benefits that the queueing community can offer in improving LLM inference systems and call for more interdisciplinary development.</p></details> |  |

This has spurred their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours, employ a "one-stage" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective, this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The second stage combines techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress models to 0.4B, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.</p></details> |  |

Problem formulation is an important part of business optimisation as it influences both the validity of solutions and the efficiency of the optimisation process. While different optimisation modelling languages have been developed, problem formulation is still not a trivial task and usually requires optimisation expertise and problem-domain knowledge. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across different language-related tasks. Since problem formulation can be viewed as a translation task, there is a potential to leverage LLMs to automate problem formulation. However, developing an LLM for problem formulation is challenging, due to limited training data, and the complexity of real-world optimisation problems. Several prompt engineering methods have been proposed in the literature to automate problem formulation with LLMs. While the initial results are encouraging, the accuracy of formulations generated by these methods can still be significantly improved. In this paper, we present an LLM-based framework for automating problem formulation in business optimization. Our approach introduces a method for fine-tuning cost-efficient LLMs specifically tailored to specialized business optimization challenges. The experiment results demonstrate that our framework can generate accurate formulations for conventional and real-world business optimisation problems in production scheduling. Extensive analyses show the effectiveness and the convergence of the proposed fine-tuning method. The proposed method also shows very competitive performance when compared with the state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods in the literature when tested on general linear programming problems.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of two complementary paradigms: Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Dataset Distillation (DD), both aimed at compressing LLMs while preserving their advanced reasoning capabilities and linguistic diversity. We first examine key methodologies in KD, such as task-specific alignment, rationale-based training, and multi-teacher frameworks, alongside DD techniques that synthesize compact, high-impact datasets through optimization-based gradient matching, latent space regularization, and generative synthesis. Building on these foundations, we explore how integrating KD and DD can produce more effective and scalable compression strategies. Together, these approaches address persistent challenges in model scalability, architectural heterogeneity, and the preservation of emergent LLM abilities. We further highlight applications across domains such as healthcare and education, where distillation enables efficient deployment without sacrificing performance. Despite substantial progress, open challenges remain in preserving emergent reasoning and linguistic diversity, enabling efficient adaptation to continually evolving teacher models and datasets, and establishing comprehensive evaluation protocols. By synthesizing methodological innovations, theoretical foundations, and practical insights, our survey charts a path toward sustainable, resource-efficient LLMs through the tighter integration of KD and DD principles.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/NVIDIA/Star-Attention</p></details> |

However, there remains a performance gap between open-source and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%, surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves model performance but also improves training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02193</p></details> |

This paper proposes InferSave, a cost-efficient VM selection framework for cloud based LLM inference. InferSave optimizes KV cache offloading based on Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and workload charac teristics, estimating GPU memory needs, and recommending cost-effective VM instances. Additionally, the Compute Time Calibration Function (CTCF) improves instance selection accuracy by adjusting for discrepancies between theoretical and actual GPU performance. Experiments on AWS GPU instances show that selecting lower-cost instances without KV cache offloading improves cost efficiency by up to 73.7% for online workloads, while KV cache offloading saves up to 20.19% for offline workloads.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike approaches relying on implicit knowledge transfer, ELTEX explicitly leverages domain signals to maintain specialized knowledge integrity. In our cybersecurity case study, ELTEX-enhanced data enables a fine-tuned Gemma-2B model to achieve performance competitive with GPT-4o on blockchain cyberattack classification while reducing computational requirements. Our Google Sheets implementation makes ELTEX accessible to non-technical users.

| **[HELIOS: Adaptive Model And Early-Exit Selection for Efficient LLM Inference Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10724v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) presents critical challenges due to the inherent trade-offs associated with key performance metrics, such as latency, accuracy, and throughput. Typically, gains in one metric is accompanied with degradation in others. Early-Exit LLMs (EE-LLMs) efficiently navigate this trade-off space by skipping some of the later model layers when it confidently finds an output token early, thus reducing latency without impacting accuracy. However, as the early exits taken depend on the task and are unknown apriori to request processing, EE-LLMs conservatively load the entire model, limiting resource savings and throughput. Also, current frameworks statically select a model for a user task, limiting our ability to adapt to changing nature of the input queries. We propose HELIOS to address these challenges. First, HELIOS shortlists a set of candidate LLMs, evaluates them using a subset of prompts, gathering telemetry data in real-time. Second, HELIOS uses the early exit data from these evaluations to greedily load the selected model only up to a limited number of layers. This approach yields memory savings which enables us to process more requests at the same time, thereby improving throughput. Third, HELIOS monitors and periodically reassesses the performance of the candidate LLMs and if needed, switches to another model that can service incoming queries more efficiently (such as using fewer layers without lowering accuracy). Our evaluations show that HELIOS achieves 1.48$\times$ throughput, 1.10$\times$ energy-efficiency, 1.39$\times$ lower response time, and 3.7$\times$ improvements in inference batch sizes compared to the baseline, when optimizing for the respective service level objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[KeepKV: Eliminating Output Perturbation in KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLMs Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09936v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Multi-view Intent Learning and Alignment with Large Language Models for Session-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13840v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based recommendation (SBR) methods often rely on user behavior data, which can struggle with the sparsity of session data, limiting performance. Researchers have identified that beyond behavioral signals, rich semantic information in item descriptions is crucial for capturing hidden user intent. While large language models (LLMs) offer new ways to leverage this semantic data, the challenges of session anonymity, short-sequence nature, and high LLM training costs have hindered the development of a lightweight, efficient LLM framework for SBR. To address the above challenges, we propose an LLM-enhanced SBR framework that integrates semantic and behavioral signals from multiple views. This two-stage framework leverages the strengths of both LLMs and traditional SBR models while minimizing training costs. In the first stage, we use multi-view prompts to infer latent user intentions at the session semantic level, supported by an intent localization module to alleviate LLM hallucinations. In the second stage, we align and unify these semantic inferences with behavioral representations, effectively merging insights from both large and small models. Extensive experiments on two real datasets demonstrate that the LLM4SBR framework can effectively improve model performance. We release our codes along with the baselines at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM4SBR.</p></details> |  |

This framework offers valuable insights into their information processing and response generation, and we further discuss the potential of leveraging quantum computing to develop significantly more powerful and efficient LLMs based on these principles.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Efficient LLM Serving on Hybrid Real-time and Best-effort Requests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09590v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled various generative tasks on a single model. Real-world services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT [27]) powered by an LLM often concurrently support latency-critical requests for interactive applications (e.g., question-answering systems, referred to as real-time or RT requests) and throughput-oriented requests for back-of-house processing (e.g., documents batch processing [28], referred to best-effort or BE requests), with complex hybrid inference workloads to the underlying model. State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM serving systems dedicate machines to each type of request, towards either low inference latency or high serving throughput, respectively. This practice simplifies request scheduling and management but suffers from poor resource utilization. We propose BROS, a hybrid LLM serving system that aims to collocate RT/BE requests, meeting RT requests' latency requirements while maintaining BE requests' throughput. BROS formulates the problem of hybrid RT/BE request scheduling and solves it with a dynamic priority-based algorithm. BROS designs a bidirectional KV cache management mechanism, allowing RT requests to share KV memory with BE requests to remove the scheduling restrictions caused by insufficient KV memory and improve utilization. Extensive experiments validate that BROS achieves a good trade-off when serving hybrid RT and BE requests. It significantly reduces the latency of RT requests (up to 74.20%), improving their fine-grained service level objectives (SLOs) attainments (up to 36.38x), with negligible throughput reduction for BE requests, showing significant advantages over SOTA systems like vLLM and TGI.</p></details> |  |

The design of LoopLynx incorporates a hybrid temporal-spatial architecture, where computationally intensive operators are implemented as large dataflow kernels. This achieves high throughput similar to spatial architecture, and organizing and reusing these kernels in a temporal way together enhances FPGA peak performance. Furthermore, to overcome the resource limitations of a single device, we provide a multi-FPGA distributed architecture that overlaps and hides all data transfers so that the distributed accelerators are fully utilized. By doing so, LoopLynx can be effectively scaled to multiple devices to further explore model parallelism for large-scale LLM inference. Evaluation of GPT-2 model demonstrates that LoopLynx can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art single FPGA-based accelerations. In addition, compared to Nvidia A100, our accelerator with a dual-FPGA configuration delivers a 2.52x speed-up in inference latency while consuming only 48.1% of the energy.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods like low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are efficient but lack flexibility, while Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures enhance model capacity at the cost of more & under-utilized parameters. To address these limitations, we propose Structural Mixture of Residual Experts (S'MoRE), a novel framework that seamlessly integrates the efficiency of LoRA with the flexibility of MoE. Specifically, S'MoRE employs hierarchical low-rank decomposition of expert weights, yielding residuals of varying orders interconnected in a multi-layer structure. By routing input tokens through sub-trees of residuals, S'MoRE emulates the capacity of many experts by instantiating and assembling just a few low-rank matrices. We craft the inter-layer propagation of S'MoRE's residuals as a special type of Graph Neural Network (GNN), and prove that under similar parameter budget, S'MoRE improves "structural flexibility" of traditional MoE (or Mixture-of-LoRA) by exponential order. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that S'MoRE achieves superior fine-tuning performance, offering a transformative approach for efficient LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |

Compression methods, such as pruning, can reduce model size, which in turn reduces resource requirements. State-of-the-art pruning is based on coarse-grained methods. They are time-consuming and inherently remove critical model parameters, adversely impacting the quality of the pruned model. This paper introduces projection pruning, a novel fine-grained method for pruning LLMs. In addition, LLM projection pruning is enhanced by a new approach we refer to as composite projection pruning - the synergistic combination of unstructured pruning that retains accuracy and structured pruning that reduces model size. We develop Mosaic, a novel system to create and deploy pruned LLMs using composite projection pruning. Mosaic is evaluated using a range of performance and quality metrics on multiple hardware platforms, LLMs, and datasets. Mosaic is 7.19x faster in producing models than existing approaches. Mosaic models achieve up to 84.2% lower perplexity and 31.4% higher accuracy than models obtained from coarse-grained pruning. Up to 67% faster inference and 68% lower GPU memory use is noted for Mosaic models.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods often utilize memory banks to handle untrimmed videos for video-level understanding. However, they typically compress visual memory using similarity-based greedy approaches, which can overlook the contextual importance of individual tokens. To address this, we introduce an efficient LLM adapter designed for video-level understanding of untrimmed videos that prioritizes the contextual relevance of spatio-temporal tokens. Our framework leverages scorer networks to selectively compress the visual memory bank and filter spatial tokens based on relevance, using a differentiable Top-K operator for end-to-end training. Across three key video-level understanding tasks$\unicode{x2013}$ untrimmed video classification, video question answering, and video captioning$\unicode{x2013}$our method achieves competitive or superior results on four large-scale datasets while reducing computational overhead by up to 34%.

While this approach improves reasoning capability, it incurs substantial computational overhead due to iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in debates for queries that do not necessitate collaboration amplifies the risk of error generation. To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate process based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For queries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses from participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate systems. We also find that confidence-guided debate mitigates error propagation and enhances the selective incorporation of reliable responses. These results establish DOWN as an optimization strategy for efficient and effective multiagent reasoning, facilitating the practical deployment of LLM-based collaboration.</p></details> |  |

As accelerators are vulnerable to hardware faults due to aging, variation, etc, existing accelerator designs often reserve a large voltage margin or leverage algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques to ensure LLM inference correctness. However, previous methods often overlook the inherent fault tolerance of LLMs, leading to high computation and energy overhead. To enable reliable yet efficient LLM inference, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm/circuit co-design framework, dubbed ReaLM. For the first time, we systematically characterize the fault tolerance of LLMs by performing a large-scale error injection study of representative LLMs and natural language understanding tasks. Then, we propose a statistical ABFT algorithm that fully leverages the error robustness to minimize error recovery as much as possible. We also customize the error detection circuits to enable a low-cost online collection of error statistics. Extensive experiments show that with only 1.42% circuit area and 1.79% power overhead, our ReaLM can reduce perplexity degradation from 18.54 to 0.29. Compared to existing methods, ReaLM consistently reduces recovery costs across different operating voltages and improves energy efficiency by up to 35.83% without compromising LLM performance.

Model quantization has emerged as a key technique to enable efficient LLM inference by reducing model size and computational overhead. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 28 quantized LLMs from the Ollama library, which applies by default Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and weight-only quantization techniques, deployed on an edge device (Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM). We evaluate energy efficiency, inference performance, and output accuracy across multiple quantization levels and task types. Models are benchmarked on five standardized datasets (CommonsenseQA, BIG-Bench Hard, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval), and we employ a high-resolution, hardware-based energy measurement tool to capture real-world power consumption. Our findings reveal the trade-offs between energy efficiency, inference speed, and accuracy in different quantization settings, highlighting configurations that optimize LLM deployment for resource-constrained environments. By integrating hardware-level energy profiling with LLM benchmarking, this study provides actionable insights for sustainable AI, bridging a critical gap in existing research on energy-aware LLM deployment.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46\% reduction in memory and 40\% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash.

During inference, efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores intermediate activations for autoregressive generation, is critical to reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency. Traditional token-level efficient KV caching methods overlook semantic information, treating tokens independently without considering their semantic relationships. Meanwhile, existing semantic-preserving KV cache management approaches often suffer from substantial memory usage and high time-to-first-token. To address these limitations, we propose SentenceKV, a novel sentence-level semantic KV caching approach designed to enhance inference efficiency while preserving semantic coherence. During prefilling, SentenceKV groups tokens based on sentence-level semantic similarity, compressing sentence representations into concise semantic vectors stored directly on the GPU, while individual KV pairs are offloaded to CPU. During decoding, SentenceKV generates tokens by selectively retrieving semantically relevant sentence-level KV entries, leveraging the semantic similarity between the prefilling-stage semantic vectors and decoding-stage queries. This ensures efficient and contextually accurate predictions, minimizing the loading of redundant or irrelevant data into GPU memory and significantly reducing memory overhead while maintaining stable inference latency, even for extremely long contexts. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including PG-19, LongBench, and Needle-In-A-Haystack demonstrate that SentenceKV significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and memory usage, without compromising model accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, this enhanced reasoning capability results in an increased number of output tokens during inference, leading to higher computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose TwT (Thinking without Tokens), a method that reduces inference-time costs through habitual reasoning distillation with multi-teachers' guidance, while maintaining high performance. Our approach introduces a Habitual Reasoning Distillation method, which internalizes explicit reasoning into the model's habitual behavior through a Teacher-Guided compression strategy inspired by human cognition. Additionally, we propose Dual-Criteria Rejection Sampling (DCRS), a technique that generates a high-quality and diverse distillation dataset using multiple teacher models, making our method suitable for unsupervised scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that TwT effectively reduces inference costs while preserving superior performance, achieving up to a 13.6% improvement in accuracy with fewer output tokens compared to other distillation methods, offering a highly practical solution for efficient LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

We define this phenomenon as model hemorrhage - performance decline caused by parameter alterations and architectural changes. Through systematic analysis of various LLM frameworks, we identify key vulnerability patterns: layer expansion frequently disrupts attention mechanisms, compression techniques induce information loss cascades, and decoding adjustments amplify prediction divergences. Our investigation reveals transformer architectures exhibit inherent robustness thresholds that determine hemorrhage severity across modification types. We propose three mitigation strategies: gradient-aware pruning preserves critical weight pathways, dynamic quantization scaling maintains activation integrity, and decoding calibration aligns generation trajectories with original model distributions. This work establishes foundational metrics for evaluating model stability during adaptation, providing practical guidelines for maintaining performance while enabling efficient LLM deployment.

This paper introduces VFlow, an automated framework that optimizes agentic workflows for Verilog code generation. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pre-defined prompting strategies, VFlow leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to discover effective sequences of Large Language Models invocations that maximize code quality while minimizing computational costs. VFlow extends the AFLOW methodology with domain-specific operators addressing hardware design requirements, including syntax validation, simulation-based verification, and synthesis optimization. Experimental evaluation on the VerilogEval benchmark demonstrates VFlow's superiority, achieving an 83.6% average pass@1 rate-a 6.1\% improvement over state-of-the-art PromptV and a 36.9\% gain compared to direct LLM invocation. Most significantly, VFlow enhances the capabilities of smaller models, enabling DeepSeek-V3 to achieve 141.2\% of GPT-4o's performance while reducing API costs to just 13\%. These findings indicate that intelligently optimized workflows enable cost-efficient LLMs to outperform larger models on hardware design tasks, potentially democratizing access to advanced digital circuit development tools and accelerating innovation in the semiconductor industry</p></details> | 6 pages |

We propose RILQ (Rank-Insensitive LoRA-based Quantization Error Compensation) to understand fundamental limitation and boost 2-bit LLM accuracy. Based on rank analysis revealing model-wise activation discrepancy loss's rank-insensitive nature, RILQ employs this loss to adjust adapters cooperatively across layers, enabling robust error compensation with low-rank adapters. Evaluations on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 demonstrate RILQ's consistent improvements in 2-bit quantized inference across various state-of-the-art quantizers and enhanced accuracy in task-specific fine-tuning. RILQ maintains computational efficiency comparable to existing LoRA methods, enabling adapter-merged weight-quantized LLM inference with significantly enhanced accuracy, making it a promising approach for boosting 2-bit LLM performance.

However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> |  |

The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |

However, fine-tuning LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices faces significant challenges, including excessive computation overhead, device heterogeneity, and data imbalance. This paper proposes SplitFrozen, a split learning framework that enables efficient LLM fine-tuning by strategically freezing device-side model layers while centralizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning on the server. Our framework partitions LLMs into device-side frozen layers and server-side fine-tuning layers, where heterogeneous resource-constrained devices execute only forward propagation. To minimize server-side training costs, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the server-side layers. A pipeline parallelism strategy further optimizes training efficiency by decoupling device-server computations and leveraging decomposed backward propagation. Experiments on GPT-2 with the MRPC, MNLI-matched, and SST-2 datasets demonstrate that SplitFrozen outperforms FedLoRA and SplitLoRA by 69.4\% model accuracy under extremely imbalanced data, while reducing up to 86.8\% device-side computations and 50.2\% total training time. Experiments also validate the scalability of SplitFrozen on content generation task using Llama-3.2 model on GSM8K dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoSTE: An Efficient Quantization-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09003v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia, Qwen and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a >300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response 30x faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, current state-of-the-art speculative decoding approaches have three key limitations: handling requests with varying difficulty using homogeneous SSMs, lack of robust support for batch processing, and insufficient holistic optimization for both speculation and verification phases. In this paper, we introduce SPIN, an efficient LLM inference serving system based on speculative decoding, designed to address these challenges through three main innovations. First, SPIN improves token speculation by using multiple heterogeneous SSMs, with a learning-based algorithm for SSM selection that operates without prior knowledge of request difficulty. Second, SPIN employs a request decomposition method to minimize batching overhead during LLM verification. Finally, SPIN orchestrates speculation and verification phases by pipelining their executions on GPUs to achieve further acceleration. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance increase of approximately 2.28X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INFOCOM 2025</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby. This article provides a contemporary survey on harnessing MEI for LLMs. We begin by illustrating several killer applications to demonstrate the urgent need for deploying LLMs at the network edge. Next, we present the preliminaries of LLMs and MEI, followed by resource-efficient LLM techniques. We then present an architectural overview of MEI for LLMs (MEI4LLM), outlining its core components and how it supports the deployment of LLMs. Subsequently, we delve into various aspects of MEI4LLM, extensively covering edge LLM caching and delivery, edge LLM training, and edge LLM inference. Finally, we identify future research opportunities. We hope this article inspires researchers in the field to leverage mobile edge computing to facilitate LLM deployment, thereby unleashing the potential of LLMs across various privacy- and delay-sensitive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 17 figures.

Thus, enabling LLMs to solve problems collaboratively by integrating their complementary knowledge promises to improve their performance across domains. To realize this potential, we introduce a novel Collaborative Speculative Decoding (CoSD) algorithm that enables efficient LLM knowledge fusion at test time without requiring additional model training. CoSD employs a draft model to generate initial sequences and an easy-to-learn rule or decision tree to decide when to invoke an assistant model to improve these drafts. CoSD not only enhances knowledge fusion but also improves inference efficiency, is transferable across domains and models, and offers greater explainability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSD improves accuracy by up to 10\% across benchmarks compared to existing methods, providing a scalable and effective solution for LLM-based applications</p></details> |  |

To comprehensively assess the motion understanding ability of existing MLLMs, we introduce FAVOR-Bench, comprising 1,776 videos with structured manual annotations of various motions. Our benchmark includes both close-ended and open-ended tasks. For close-ended evaluation, we carefully design 8,184 multiple-choice question-answer pairs spanning six distinct sub-tasks. For open-ended evaluation, we develop both a novel cost-efficient LLM-free and a GPT-assisted caption assessment method, where the former can enhance benchmarking interpretability and reproducibility. Comprehensive experiments with 21 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations in their ability to comprehend and describe detailed temporal dynamics in video motions. To alleviate this limitation, we further build FAVOR-Train, a dataset consisting of 17,152 videos with fine-grained motion annotations. The results of finetuning Qwen2.5-VL on FAVOR-Train yield consistent improvements on motion-related tasks of TVBench, MotionBench and our FAVOR-Bench.

However, previous research observes that certain weights in the LLM, known as outliers, are significantly sensitive to quantization noises. Existing quantization methods leave these outliers as floating points or higher precisions to retain performance, posting challenges on the efficient hardware deployment of the mixed-precision model. This work investigates an alternative way to tame the sensitive weights' impact on the quantization error, by reducing the loss Hessian trace with respect to outliers through an efficient fine-tuning process. We propose Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning (NPFT), which identifies outlier weights and add random weight perturbations on the outliers as the model going through a PEFT optimization. NPFT tames the sensitivity of outlier weights so that the quantized model performance can be improved without special treatment to the outliers. When applied to OPT and LLaMA models, our NPFT method achieves stable performance improvements for both uniform and non-uniform quantizers, while also offering better inference efficiency. Notably, the simplest RTN can achieve performance on par with GPTQ using our NPFT on LLaMA2-7B-4bits benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster by CPAL2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards An Efficient LLM Training Paradigm for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01001v3)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential as the next-generation ranking-based recommendation system. Many recent works have shown that LLMs can significantly outperform conventional click-through-rate (CTR) prediction approaches. Despite such promising results, the computational inefficiency inherent in the current training paradigm makes it particularly challenging to train LLMs for ranking-based recommendation tasks on large datasets. To train LLMs for CTR prediction, most existing studies adopt the prevalent ''sliding-window'' paradigm. Given a sequence of $m$ user interactions, a unique training prompt is constructed for each interaction by designating it as the prediction target along with its preceding $n$ interactions serving as context. In turn, the sliding-window paradigm results in an overall complexity of $O(mn^2)$ that scales linearly with the length of user interactions. Consequently, a direct adoption to train LLMs with such strategy can result in prohibitively high training costs as the length of interactions grows. To alleviate the computational inefficiency, we propose a novel training paradigm, namely Dynamic Target Isolation (DTI), that structurally parallelizes the training of $k$ (where $k >> 1$) target interactions. Furthermore, we identify two major bottlenecks - hidden-state leakage and positional bias overfitting - that limit DTI to only scale up to a small value of $k$ (e.g., 5) then propose a computationally light solution to effectively tackle each. Through extensive experiments on three widely adopted public CTR datasets, we empirically show that DTI reduces training time by an average of $\textbf{92%}$ (e.g., from $70.5$ hrs to $5.31$ hrs), without compromising CTR prediction performance.</p></details> |  |

In the e-commerce domain, prompting-based applications are widely used for tasks such as query understanding, recommender systems, and customer support. However, adapting LLMs to different tasks often requires extensive prompt engineering by domain experts, along with frequent updates to align with evolving business needs. Additionally, crafting fully unbiased natural language prompts remains a challenge for humans. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Examples as the Prompt (EaP) which leverages labeled data to enhance prompts. Specifically, EaP automatically selects the most representative examples to maximize the few-shot capability of LLMs. It is efficient due to its unsupervised example selection and adaptive to potential data distribution shifts. We validate EaP on four real-world production use cases, demonstrating that it achieves comparable or even superior performance comparing to hand-crafted prompts designed by domain experts. Additionally, we introduce EaP_lite, which entirely replaces the natural language components of prompts with labeled examples. EaP_lite improves LLM inference speed by up to 70% without compromising performance. Latest online A/B test shows that using EaP and EaP_lite for data labeling can bring significant composite revenue gain by 0.06%.</p></details> |  |

However, the autoregressive nature of these models makes the inference process slow and costly. Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging a smaller auxiliary model to draft future tokens, which are then validated simultaneously by the larger model, achieving a speed-up of 1-2x. Although speculative decoding matches the same distribution as multinomial sampling, multinomial sampling itself is prone to suboptimal outputs, whereas beam sampling is widely recognized for producing higher-quality results by maintaining multiple candidate sequences at each step. This paper explores the novel integration of speculative decoding with beam sampling. However, there are four key challenges: (1) how to generate multiple sequences from the larger model's distribution given drafts sequences from the small model; (2) how to dynamically optimize the number of beams to balance efficiency and accuracy; (3) how to efficiently verify the multiple drafts in parallel; and (4) how to address the extra memory costs inherent in beam sampling. To address these challenges, we propose dynamic-width speculative beam decoding (DSBD). Specifically, we first introduce a novel draft and verification scheme that generates multiple sequences following the large model's distribution based on beam sampling trajectories from the small model. Then, we introduce an adaptive mechanism to dynamically tune the number of beams based on the context, optimizing efficiency and effectiveness. Besides, we extend tree-based parallel verification to handle multiple trees simultaneously, accelerating the verification process. Finally, we illustrate a simple modification to our algorithm to mitigate the memory overhead of beam sampling...</p></details> |  |

However, the challenge lies in automatically identifying valuable subsets from large datasets to boost both the effectiveness and efficiency of instruction tuning. In this paper, we first establish data selection criteria based on three distinct aspects of data value: diversity, difficulty, and dependability, and then propose the D3 method comprising two key steps of scoring and selection. Specifically, in the scoring step, we define the diversity function to measure sample distinctiveness and introduce the uncertainty-based prediction difficulty to evaluate sample difficulty by mitigating the interference of context-oriented generation diversity. Additionally, we integrate an external LLM for dependability assessment. In the selection step, we formulate the D3 weighted coreset objective, which jointly optimizes three aspects of data value to solve for the most valuable subset. The two steps of D3 can iterate multiple rounds, incorporating feedback to refine the selection focus adaptively. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of D3 in endowing LLMs with competitive or even superior instruction-following capabilities using less than 10% of the entire dataset.</p></details> |  |

The self-attention mechanism provides a general solution for sequence modeling, but it has a prohibitive cost when applied to a massive number of spatiotemporal tokens in long videos. Most prior methods rely on compression strategies to lower the computational cost, such as reducing the input length via sparse frame sampling or compressing the output sequence passed to the large language model (LLM) via space-time pooling. However, these naive approaches over-represent redundant information and often miss salient events or fast-occurring space-time patterns. In this work, we introduce BIMBA, an efficient state-space model to handle long-form videos. Our model leverages the selective scan algorithm to learn to effectively select critical information from high-dimensional video and transform it into a reduced token sequence for efficient LLM processing.

This approach enhances the efficiency of inference serving by reducing LLM inference latency and costs while preserving generation quality. However, existing speculative methods face critical challenges, including inefficient resource utilization and limited draft acceptance, which constrain their scalability and overall effectiveness. To overcome these obstacles, we present CoSine, a novel speculative inference system that decouples sequential speculative decoding from parallel verification, enabling efficient collaboration among multiple nodes. Specifically, CoSine routes inference requests to specialized drafters based on their expertise and incorporates a confidence-based token fusion mechanism to synthesize outputs from cooperating drafters, ensuring high-quality draft generation. Additionally, CoSine dynamically orchestrates the execution of speculative decoding and verification in a pipelined manner, employing batch scheduling to selectively group requests and adaptive speculation control to minimize idle periods. By optimizing parallel workflows through heterogeneous node collaboration, CoSine balances draft generation and verification throughput in real-time, thereby maximizing resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSine achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art speculative approaches. Notably, with equivalent resource costs, CoSine achieves up to a 23.2% decrease in latency and a 32.5% increase in throughput compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines which blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance degradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms uniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while reducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ across multiple architectures -- from 1.6B to 70B parameters -- and showcase consistent improvements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or architectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce perplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of beneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This improvement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental relationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements. Additionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution analysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique leverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across various architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization decisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy analysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be developed independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes, opening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures, 14 tables; Fixed some types, added some clarifications and improvements</p></details> |

Speculative decoding, which exploits lightweight models for drafting and LLMs for verification, has emerged as a compelling technique to accelerate LLM inference.

In this paper, we introduce SpecServe, an efficient LLM inference system that dynamically adjusts speculative strategies according to real-time request loads and system configurations. SpecServe proposes a theoretical model to understand and predict the efficiency of speculative decoding across diverse scenarios. Additionally, it implements intelligent drafting and verification algorithms to guarantee optimal performance while achieving high SLO attainment. Experimental results on real-world LLM traces demonstrate that SpecServe consistently meets SLOs and achieves substantial performance improvements, yielding 1.14$\times$-14.3$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art speculative inference systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallelized Planning-Acting for Efficient LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03505v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Model(LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) have demonstrated remarkable potential for tackling complex decision-making tasks. However, existing frameworks inevitably rely on serialized execution paradigms, where agents must complete sequential LLM planning before taking action. This fundamental constraint severely limits real-time responsiveness and adaptation, which is crucial in dynamic environments with ever-changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel parallelized planning-acting framework for LLM-based MAS, featuring a dual-thread architecture with interruptible execution to enable concurrent planning and acting. Specifically, our framework comprises two core threads:(1) a planning thread driven by a centralized memory system, maintaining synchronization of environmental states and agent communication to support dynamic decision-making; and (2) an acting thread equipped with a comprehensive skill library, enabling automated task execution through recursive decomposition. Extensive experiments on challenging Minecraft demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Memory Efficiency in Large Language Model Training Through Chronos-aware Pipeline Parallelism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03182v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Larger model sizes and longer sequence lengths have empowered the Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve outstanding performance across various domains. However, this progress brings significant storage capacity challenges for LLM pretraining. High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is expensive and requires more advanced packaging technologies for capacity expansion, creating an urgent need for memory-efficient scheduling strategies. Yet, prior pipeline parallelism schedules have primarily focused on reducing bubble overhead, often neglecting memory efficiency and lacking compatibility with other memory-efficient strategies. Consequently, these methods struggle to meet the storage demands of storage capacity for next-generation LLM. This work presents ChronosPipe, a Chronos-aware pipeline parallelism for memory-efficient LLM pretraining. The core insight of ChronosPipe is to treat HBM as a fast but small 'cache,' optimizing and exploiting temporal locality within LLM pretraining to enhance HBM utilization. ChronosPipe introduces a pipeline scheduling strategy, Chronos-Pipe, to reduce the extrinsic overhead that disrupts the temporal locality of activations. Additionally, it leverages Chronos-Recomp and Chronos-Offload to efficiently harness the intrinsic temporal locality of activations and weights in Deep Neural Networks. Experiment results show that ChronosPipe can expand the trainable model size by 2.4x while maintaining comparable throughput, achieving 1.5x better than the 1F1B strategy combined with recomputation.</p></details> |  |

However existing LLM UM methods struggle with long user generated content UGC due to context limitations and performance degradation. To address this sampling strategies prioritize relevance or recency are often applied yet they inevitably neglect the diverse user interests embedded within the discarded behaviors resulting in incomplete modeling and degraded profiling quality. Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and offline multi persona construction. PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval. This approach ensures that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. For SBS selection we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational quality by balancing prototypicality and diversity within the sampled data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in high quality user profiling. Utilizing only 30 to 50 percent of the behavioral data with a sequence length of 480 integrating PersonaX with AgentCF yields an absolute performance improvement of 3 to 11 percent while integration with Agent4Rec results in a gain of 10 to 50 percent. PersonaX as an agent agnostic framework sets a new benchmark for scalable user modeling paving the way for more accurate and efficient LLM driven recommendation agents.</p></details> | draft paper |
| **[Spread Preference Annotation: Direct Preference Judgment for Efficient LLM Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04412v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences becomes a key component to obtaining state-of-the-art performance, but it yields a huge cost to construct a large human-annotated preference dataset. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework, Spread Preference Annotation with direct preference judgment (SPA), that boosts the alignment of LLMs using only a very small amount of human-annotated preference data. Our key idea is leveraging the human prior knowledge within the small (seed) data and progressively improving the alignment of LLM, by iteratively generating the responses and learning from them with the self-annotated preference data. To be specific, we propose to derive the preference label from the logits of LLM to explicitly extract the model's inherent preference. Compared to the previous approaches using external reward models or implicit in-context learning, we observe that the proposed approach is significantly more effective. In addition, we introduce a noise-aware preference learning algorithm to mitigate the risk of low quality within generated preference data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly boosts the alignment of LLMs. For example, we achieve superior alignment performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 with only 3.3% of the ground-truth preference labels in the Ultrafeedback data compared to the cases using the entire data or state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Oral Presentation, 22 pages</p></details> |

However, existing foundation models rely on multi-stage processing or complex architectures for predicting multiple codebooks, limiting efficiency and integration flexibility. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spark-TTS, a novel system powered by BiCodec, a single-stream speech codec that decomposes speech into two complementary token types: low-bitrate semantic tokens for linguistic content and fixed-length global tokens for speaker attributes. This disentangled representation, combined with the Qwen2.5 LLM and a chain-of-thought (CoT) generation approach, enables both coarse-grained control (e.g., gender, speaking style) and fine-grained adjustments (e.g., precise pitch values, speaking rate). To facilitate research in controllable TTS, we introduce VoxBox, a meticulously curated 100,000-hour dataset with comprehensive attribute annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Spark-TTS not only achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning but also generates highly customizable voices that surpass the limitations of reference-based synthesis.

Previous LoRA-based approaches initialize the low-rank matrices with Gaussian distribution and zero values while keeping the original weight matrices frozen. However, the trainable model parameters optimized in an unguided subspace might interfere with the well-learned subspace of the pretrained weight matrices. In this paper, we propose MiLoRA, a simple yet effective LLM finetuning approach that only updates the minor singular components of the weight matrix while keeping the principal singular components frozen. It is observed that the minor matrix corresponds to the noisy or long-tail information, while the principal matrix contains important knowledge. The MiLoRA initializes the low-rank matrices within a subspace that is orthogonal to the principal matrix, thus the pretrained knowledge is expected to be well preserved. During finetuning, MiLoRA makes the most use of the less-optimized subspace for learning the labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, instruction following and visual instruction following benchmarks present the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at NAACL 2025.

However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.

| **[Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13461v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spite of the great potential of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to their excessive computational and memory demands. Quantization has emerged as an effective solution by storing weights in reduced precision. However, utilizing low precisions (i.e.~2/3-bit) to substantially alleviate the memory-boundedness of LLM decoding, still suffers from prohibitive performance drop. In this work, we argue that existing approaches fail to explore the diversity in computational patterns, redundancy, and sensitivity to approximations of the different phases of LLM inference, resorting to a uniform quantization policy throughout. Instead, we propose a novel phase-aware method that selectively allocates precision during different phases of LLM inference, achieving both strong context extraction during prefill and efficient memory bandwidth utilization during decoding. To further address the memory-boundedness of the decoding phase, we introduce Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding (PMPD), a technique that enables the gradual lowering of precision deeper in the generated sequence, together with a spectrum of precision-switching schedulers that dynamically drive the precision-lowering decisions in either task-adaptive or prompt-adaptive manner. Extensive evaluation across diverse language tasks shows that when targeting Nvidia GPUs, PMPD achieves 1.4$-$12.2$\times$ speedup in matrix-vector multiplications over fp16 models, while when targeting an LLM-optimized NPU, our approach delivers a throughput gain of 3.8$-$8.0$\times$ over fp16 models and up to 1.54$\times$ over uniform quantization approaches while preserving the output quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Parallel Tree Search for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16235v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, their growing capabilities come at the cost of extremely large model sizes, making deployment on edge devices challenging due to memory and computational constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach to LLM weight pruning that directly optimizes for approximating the attention matrix, a core component of transformer architectures. Unlike existing methods that focus on linear approximations, our approach accounts for the non-linear nature of the Softmax attention mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our Gradient Descent-based optimization method to a near-optimal pruning mask solution. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-linear pruning approach in maintaining model performance while significantly reducing computational costs, which is beyond the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e., SparseGPT and Wanda, by a large margin. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for pruning algorithm design in LLMs, potentially paving the way for more efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities in this domain, challenges remain in terms of interpretability and computational efficiency. This paper introduces Evidence-Driven LLM (ED-LLM), a novel approach for clinical marker extraction and suicide risk classification. ED-LLM employs a multi-task learning framework, jointly training a Mistral-7B based model to identify clinical marker spans and classify suicide risk levels. This evidence-driven strategy enhances interpretability by explicitly highlighting textual evidence supporting risk assessments. Evaluated on the CLPsych datasets, ED-LLM demonstrates competitive performance in risk classification and superior capability in clinical marker span identification compared to baselines including fine-tuned LLMs, traditional machine learning, and prompt-based methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of multi-task learning for interpretable and efficient LLM-based suicide risk assessment, paving the way for clinically relevant applications.</p></details> |  |

To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, indiscriminate pruning disrupts representation stability, leading to performance degradation. We propose GRASP (Gradient-based Retention of Adaptive Singular Parameters), which preserves representation-critical singular values to mitigate these effects. Unlike direct layer removal, GRASP leverages gradient-based attribution on a syntax- and semantics-rich dataset to guide the selection of representation-critical singular values. By selectively applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to affected layers, GRASP achieves efficient compression while maintaining representation stability with minimal overhead. Experiments across multiple LLMs show that GRASP consistently outperforms existing compression methods in perplexity and downstream task performance.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques typically employ additive adapters applied to frozen model weights. To further reduce memory usage, model weights can be compressed through quantization. However, existing PEFT methods often yield suboptimal model quality due to restrictive assumptions, such as imposing low-rank constraints on adapters to reduce trainable parameters. We find that sketching, a popular data compression technique, can serve as an efficient adaptation strategy for LLMs while avoiding low-rank assumptions. We introduce SketchTune, a compressive adaptation strategy that compresses LLM weights into compact fine-tunable sketches, integrating compression and adaptation into a unified framework. This integration eliminates the need for complex two-path computation common in existing PEFT techniques, enabling faster and more memory-efficient training and inference. SketchTune is supported by mathematical insights into matrix classes that are better approximated using sketching rather than low-rank methods. Our rigorous evaluations with Llama-1/2/3 models demonstrate that SketchTune outperforms leading PEFT methods across diverse tasks including math problem-solving, common sense reasoning, and instruction following, while using substantially smaller base models and comparable trainable parameters. As a highlight, SketchTune outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and S2FT on commonsense and math benchmarks using 2.6-3.5$\times$ smaller base models and exceeds LoftQ in accuracy by 14.48% on GSM8K with 7.3$\times$ fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |

As LLM-assisted services become popular, achieving cost-effective LLM inference on budget-friendly hardware becomes the trend. Extensive researches relocate LLM parameters from expensive GPUs to host memory. However, the restricted bandwidth between the host and GPU memory limits the inference performance. This work introduces Hermes, a budget-friendly system that leverages the near-data processing (NDP) within commodity DRAM DIMMs to enhance the performance of a single consumer-grade GPU, achieving efficient LLM inference. The inherent activation sparsity in LLMs naturally divides weight parameters into two categories, termed ``hot" and ``cold" neurons, respectively. Hot neurons, which consist of only approximately 20\% of all weight parameters, account for 80\% of the total computational load, while cold neurons make up the other 80\% of parameters but are responsible for just 20\% of the computational load. Therefore, we propose a heterogeneous computing strategy: mapping hot neurons to a single computation-efficient GPU, while offloading cold neurons to NDP-DIMMs, which offer large memory size but limited computation capabilities. Meanwhile, the dynamic nature of activation sparsity needs a real-time partition of hot/cold neurons and adaptive remapping of cold neurons across multiple NDP-DIMM modules. Therefore, we introduce a lightweight predictor optimizing real-time neuron partition and adjustment between GPU and NDP-DIMMs. We also utilize a window-based online scheduling mechanism to maintain load balance among NDP-DIMM modules. Hermes facilitates the deployment of LLaMA2-70B on consumer-grade hardware at 13.75 tokens/s and realizes an average 75.24$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading-based inference system.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, accepted by HPCA 2025</p></details> |

Although scaling laws indicate that larger models generally yield better generalization and performance, their substantial computational requirements often render them impractical for many real-world scenarios at scale. In this paper, we present methods and insights for training small language models (SLMs) that deliver high performance and efficiency in deployment. We focus on two key techniques: (1) knowledge distillation and (2) model compression via quantization and pruning. These approaches enable SLMs to retain much of the quality of their larger counterparts while significantly reducing training, serving costs, and latency. We detail the impact of these techniques on a variety of use cases at a large professional social network platform and share deployment lessons - including hardware optimization strategies that enhance speed and throughput for both predictive and reasoning-based applications.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces VLBias, a framework that leverages state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs to detect linguistic and visual biases in news content. We present a multimodal dataset comprising textual content and corresponding images from diverse news sources. We propose a hybrid annotation framework that combines LLM-based annotations with human review to ensure high-quality labeling while reducing costs and enhancing scalability. Our evaluation compares the performance of state-of-the-art SLMs and LLMs for both modalities (text and images) and the results reveal that while SLMs are computationally efficient, LLMs demonstrate superior accuracy in identifying subtle framing and text-visual inconsistencies. Furthermore, empirical analysis shows that incorporating visual cues alongside textual data improves bias detection accuracy by 3 to 5%. This study provides a comprehensive exploration of LLMs, SLMs, and VLMs as tools for detecting multimodal biases in news content and highlights their respective strengths, limitations, and potential for future applications</p></details> | Under review |

We introduce Synthetic Educational Feedback Loops (SEFL), a novel framework designed to deliver immediate, on-demand feedback at scale without relying on extensive, real-world student data. In SEFL, two large language models (LLMs) operate in teacher--student roles to simulate assignment completion and formative feedback, generating abundant synthetic pairs of student work and corresponding critiques. We then fine-tune smaller, more computationally efficient LLMs on these synthetic pairs, enabling them to replicate key features of high-quality, goal-oriented feedback. Unlike personalized tutoring approaches that offer multi-turn, individualized instruction, SEFL specifically focuses on replicating the teacher-->student feedback loop for diverse assignments. Through both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations, we demonstrate that SEFL-tuned models outperform their non-tuned counterparts in feedback quality, clarity, and timeliness. These findings reveal SEFL's potential to transform feedback processes for higher education and beyond, offering an ethical and scalable alternative to conventional manual feedback cycles.</p></details> |  |

Extending the context length has disproportionately shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during inference to the key-value cache (KV cache). In this paper, we propose HEADINFER, which offloads the KV cache to CPU RAM while avoiding the need to fully store the KV cache for any transformer layer on the GPU. HEADINFER employs a fine-grained, head-wise offloading strategy, maintaining only selective attention heads KV cache on the GPU while computing attention output dynamically. Through roofline analysis, we demonstrate that HEADINFER maintains computational efficiency while significantly reducing memory footprint. We evaluate HEADINFER on the Llama-3-8B model with a 1-million-token sequence, reducing the GPU memory footprint of the KV cache from 128 GB to 1 GB and the total GPU memory usage from 207 GB to 17 GB, achieving a 92% reduction compared to BF16 baseline inference. Notably, HEADINFER enables 4-million-token inference with an 8B model on a single consumer GPU with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without approximation methods.</p></details> |  |

This memory burden necessitates using more or higher-end GPUs or reducing batch sizes, limiting training scalability and throughput. To address this, various memory-efficient optimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they face critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii) significant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still substantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance. In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be effectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this insight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM Optimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This structured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further memory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even its rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance compared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly eliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant system-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB setup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes. (2) Improved Model Scalability: Pre-training LLaMA-13B with naive DDP on A100-80GB GPUs without system-level optimizations.

However, scaling LLMs to support multiple downstream domain applications remains a significant challenge, especially under resource constraints. Existing approaches often struggle to balance performance across multiple domains with resource efficiency, limiting their broader applicability. To address this, we introduce the CCoE architecture, a modular framework that seamlessly integrates domain-specific experts into a unified LLM. By leveraging independently trained expert subnetworks on a shared backbone partition, CCoE achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the resource requirements for multi-expert deployments. Furthermore, rule-based gating and expert planning in CCoE enable flexible task allocation, promoting expert collaboration to handle complex reasoning tasks. CCoE not only reduces inference costs but also provides a flexible and scalable solution for integrating domain expertise across diverse applications. Experiments on five domains demonstrate that CCoE achieves comparable performance to current domain-specific LLMs. Moreover, compared to existing multi-domain model ensemble methods, CCoE reduces memory usage by 61.3%, while improving inference efficiency by 0.76x over parameter-efficient multi-expert integration approaches.</p></details> |  |

Context caching improves serving performance by exploiting inter-request dependency and reusing key-value (KV) cache across requests, thus improving time-to-first-token (TTFT). However, existing prefix-based context caching requires exact token prefix matches, limiting cache reuse in few-shot learning, multi-document QA, or retrieval-augmented generation, where prefixes may vary. In this paper, we present EPIC, an LLM serving system that introduces position-independent context caching (PIC), enabling modular KV cache reuse regardless of token chunk position (or prefix). EPIC features two key designs: AttnLink, which leverages static attention sparsity to minimize recomputation for accuracy recovery, and KVSplit, a customizable chunking method that preserves semantic coherence. Our experiments demonstrate that Epic delivers up to 8x improvements in TTFT and 7x throughput over existing systems, with negligible or no accuracy loss. By addressing the limitations of traditional caching approaches, Epic enables more scalable and efficient LLM inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Uncertainty Estimation for Efficient LLM Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11021v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) in edge-cloud environments requires an efficient routing strategy to balance cost and response quality. Traditional approaches prioritize either human-preference data or accuracy metrics from benchmark datasets as routing criteria, but these methods suffer from rigidity and subjectivity. Moreover, existing routing frameworks primarily focus on accuracy and cost, neglecting response quality from a human preference perspective. In this work, we propose the Confidence-Driven LLM Router, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty estimation to optimize routing decisions. To comprehensively assess routing performance, we evaluate both system cost efficiency and response quality. In particular, we introduce the novel use of LLM-as-a-Judge to simulate human rating preferences, providing the first systematic assessment of response quality across different routing strategies. Extensive experiments on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and MMLU demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art routing methods, achieving superior response quality while maintaining cost efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pushing up to the Limit of Memory Bandwidth and Capacity Utilization for Efficient LLM Decoding on Embedded FPGA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10659v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extremely high computational and storage demands of large language models have excluded most edge devices, which were widely used for efficient machine learning, from being viable options. A typical edge device usually only has 4GB of memory capacity and a bandwidth of less than 20GB/s, while a large language model quantized to 4-bit precision with 7B parameters already requires 3.5GB of capacity, and its decoding process is purely bandwidth-bound. In this paper, we aim to explore these limits by proposing a hardware accelerator for large language model (LLM) inference on the Zynq-based KV260 platform, equipped with 4GB of 64-bit 2400Mbps DDR4 memory. We successfully deploy a LLaMA2-7B model, achieving a decoding speed of around 5 token/s, utilizing 93.3% of the memory capacity and reaching 85% decoding speed of the theoretical memory bandwidth limit. To fully reserve the memory capacity for model weights and key-value cache, we develop the system in a bare-metal environment without an operating system. To fully reserve the bandwidth for model weight transfers, we implement a customized dataflow with an operator fusion pipeline and propose a data arrangement format that can maximize the data transaction efficiency. This research marks the first attempt to deploy a 7B level LLM on a standalone embedded field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. It provides key insights into efficient LLM inference on embedded FPGA devices and provides guidelines for future architecture design.</p></details> | Accepted by DATE2025 |

However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, FineWeb, FineWeb-Edu, and DCLM. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training. We are open-sourcing ProX with >500B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

| **[Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19324v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. We theoretically demonstrate that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/BaohaoLiao/RSD.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[SELP: Generating Safe and Efficient Task Plans for Robot Agents with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19471v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) that enhance robot agents' understanding and execution of natural language (NL) commands, ensuring the agents adhere to user-specified constraints remains challenging, particularly for complex commands and long-horizon tasks. To address this challenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained decoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM planners' capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures consistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the majority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then uses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of plans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. Domain-specific fine-tuning customizes LLMs to produce safe and efficient plans within specific task domains. Our approach, Safe Efficient LLM Planner (SELP), combines these insights to create LLM planners to generate plans adhering to user commands with high confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SELP across different robot agents and tasks, including drone navigation and robot manipulation. For drone navigation tasks, SELP outperforms state-of-the-art planners by 10.8% in safety rate (i.e., finishing tasks conforming to NL commands) and by 19.8% in plan efficiency. For robot manipulation tasks, SELP achieves 20.4% improvement in safety rate. Our datasets for evaluating NL-to-LTL and robot task planning will be released in github.com/lt-asset/selp.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), May 19-23, 2025, Atlanta, USA, and for inclusion in the conference proceeding</p></details> |
| **[On multi-token prediction for efficient LLM inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09419v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We systematically investigate multi-token prediction (MTP) capabilities within LLMs pre-trained for next-token prediction (NTP). We first show that such models inherently possess MTP capabilities via numerical marginalization over intermediate token probabilities, though performance is data-dependent and improves with model scale. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of integrating MTP heads into frozen LLMs and find that their hidden layers are strongly specialized for NTP, making adaptation non-trivial. Finally, we show that while joint training of MTP heads with the backbone improves performance, it cannot fully overcome this barrier, prompting further research in this direction. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of MTP applied to pretrained LLMs, informing strategies for accelerating inference through parallel token prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThunderServe: High-performance and Cost-efficient LLM Serving in Cloud Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09334v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable proficiency in a range of tasks. Compared to in-house homogeneous GPU clusters, deploying LLMs in cloud environments with diverse types of GPUs is crucial for addressing the GPU shortage problem and being more cost-effective. However, the diversity of network environments and various GPU types on the cloud bring difficulties to achieving high-performance serving. In this work, we propose ThunderServe, a high-performance and cost-efficient LLM serving system for heterogeneous cloud environments. We introduce a novel scheduling algorithm, which optimizes the deployment plan of LLM serving to accommodate the heterogeneous resource and network bandwidth conditions in cloud environments. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight re-scheduling mechanism, designed to adapt to fluctuating online conditions (e.g., node failures, workload shifts) without the need for costly restarts of ongoing services. Empirical results in both heterogeneous cloud and homogeneous in-house environments reveal that ThunderServe delivers up to a 2.1$\times$ and on average a $1.7\times$ increase in throughput and achieves up to a 2.5$\times$ and on average a $1.5\times$ reduction in latency deadlines compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, suggesting opting for cloud services provides a more cost-efficient solution.</p></details> | MLSys 2025 |
| **[Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency for Effective and Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00511v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. However, single-shot inference often yields unreliable results for complex reasoning tasks, leading researchers to explore multiple reasoning paths through methods such as perplexity and self-consistency. In this paper, we present the first theoretical error decomposition analysis of these techniques, breaking down their error into estimation error and model error. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: perplexity methods suffer from substantial model error due to the absence of a proper consistency function, while self-consistency exhibits high estimation error due to a slow error convergence rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reasoning-Pruning Perplexity Consistency (RPC). This approach combines Perplexity Consistency, which seamlessly integrates LLM perplexity with self-consistency, and Reasoning Pruning, which eliminates low-probability reasoning paths to effectively prevent the degeneration of estimation error reduction. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that RPC not only accelerates the convergence rate of estimation error to an exponential level but also holds strong potential for further reducing model error. Extensive empirical evaluations on seven benchmark datasets confirm that RPC can significantly improve reasoning performance, sample efficiency, and confidence reliability.</p></details> | Preliminary work |
| **[DiffoRA: Enabling Parameter-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning via Differential Low-Rank Matrix Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08905v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have been extensively researched for large language models in the downstream tasks. Among all the existing approaches, the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for its streamlined design by incorporating low-rank matrices into existing pre-trained models. Though effective, LoRA allocates every module an identical low-rank matrix, which ignores the varying properties and contributions across different components. Moreover, the existing adaptive LoRA solutions rely highly on intuitive importance scoring indicators to adjust the interior rank of the decomposition matrices. In this paper, we propose a new PEFT scheme called DiffoRA, which is theoretically grounded and enables module-wise adoption of LoRA. At the core of our DiffoRA lies a Differential Adaptation Matrix (DAM) to determine which module is the most suitable and essential for fine-tuning. We explain how the designed matrix impacts the convergence rate and generalization capability of a pre-trained model. Furthermore, we construct the DAM via continuous relaxation and discretization with weight-sharing optimizations. We fully implement our DiffoRA and design comprehensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the best model accuracy over all the state-of-the-art baselines across various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Model Routing for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08773v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models' significant advances in capabilities are accompanied by significant increases in inference costs. Model routing is a simple technique for reducing inference cost, wherein one maintains a pool of candidate LLMs, and learns to route each prompt to the smallest feasible LLM. Existing works focus on learning a router for a fixed pool of LLMs. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic routing, where new, previously unobserved LLMs are available at test time. We propose a new approach to this problem that relies on representing each LLM as a feature vector, derived based on predictions on a set of representative prompts. Based on this, we detail two effective strategies, relying on cluster-based routing and a learned cluster map respectively. We prove that these strategies are estimates of a theoretically optimal routing rule, and provide an excess risk bound to quantify their errors. Experiments on a range of public benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed strategies in routing amongst more than 30 unseen LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoLoRec: A Generalizable and Efficient Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08271v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in recent years, owing to their impressive generalization capabilities and rich world knowledge. To capitalize on the potential of using LLMs as recommender systems, mainstream approaches typically focus on two paradigms. The first paradigm designs multi-domain or multi-task instruction data for generalizable recommendation, so as to align LLMs with general recommendation areas and deal with cold-start recommendation. The second paradigm enhances domain-specific recommendation tasks with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, in order to improve models under the warm recommendation scenarios. While most previous works treat these two paradigms separately, we argue that they have complementary advantages, and combining them together would be helpful. To that end, in this paper, we propose a generalizable and efficient LLM-based recommendation framework MoLoRec. Our approach starts by parameter-efficient fine-tuning a domain-general module with general recommendation instruction data, to align LLM with recommendation knowledge. Then, given users' behavior of a specific domain, we construct a domain-specific instruction dataset and apply efficient fine-tuning to the pre-trained LLM. After that, we provide approaches to integrate the above domain-general part and domain-specific part with parameters mixture. Please note that, MoLoRec is efficient with plug and play, as the domain-general module is trained only once, and any domain-specific plug-in can be efficiently merged with only domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under both warm and cold-start recommendation scenarios validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed MoLoRec.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel token-level attack method, Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), which has been shown to successfully jailbreak multiple open-source LLMs. Drawing inspiration from the difficulties of discrete token optimization, our method relaxes the discrete jailbreak optimization into a continuous optimization process while gradually increasing the sparsity of the optimizing vectors. This technique effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art token-level methods. On Harmbench, our approach achieves the highest attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs compared to the latest jailbreak methods. Trigger Warning: This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mediator: Memory-efficient LLM Merging with Less Parameter Conflicts and Uncertainty Based Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04411v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into a stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>work ...</summary><p>work in progress. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.09673 by other authors</p></details> |

The existing deployment model, which dedicates machines to each workload, simplifies SLO management but often leads to poor resource utilization. This paper introduces HyGen, an interference-aware LLM serving system that enables efficient co-location of online and offline workloads while preserving latency requirements. HyGen incorporates two key innovations: (1) performance control mechanisms, including a latency predictor to estimate batch execution time and an SLO-aware profiler to quantify latency interference, and (2) SLO-aware offline scheduling policies that maximize serving throughput and prevent starvation, without compromising online serving latency. Our evaluation on production workloads shows that HyGen achieves up to 3.87x overall throughput and 5.84x offline throughput gains over online and hybrid serving baselines, respectively, while strictly satisfying latency SLOs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

However most works don't target the largest component of allocated memory during training: the model's compute graph, which is stored for the backward pass. By storing low-rank, compressed activations to be used in the backward pass we greatly reduce the required memory, unlike previous methods which only reduce optimizer overheads or the number of trained parameters. Our compression uses random projection matrices, thus avoiding additional memory overheads. Comparisons with previous techniques for either pretraining or fine-tuning show that CompAct substantially improves existing compute-performance tradeoffs. We expect CompAct's savings to scale even higher for larger models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |
