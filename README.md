| **[Why Does New Knowledge Create Messy Ripple Effects in LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12828v3)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extensive previous research has focused on post-training knowledge editing (KE) for language models (LMs) to ensure that knowledge remains accurate and up-to-date. One desired property and open question in KE is to let edited LMs correctly handle ripple effects, where LM is expected to answer its logically related knowledge accurately. In this paper, we answer the question of why most KE methods still create messy ripple effects. We conduct extensive analysis and identify a salient indicator, GradSim, that effectively reveals when and why updated knowledge ripples in LMs. GradSim is computed by the cosine similarity between gradients of the original fact and its related knowledge. We observe a strong positive correlation between ripple effect performance and GradSim across different LMs, KE methods, and evaluation metrics. Further investigations into three counter-intuitive failure cases (Negation, Over-Ripple, Multi-Lingual) of ripple effects demonstrate that these failures are often associated with very low GradSim. This finding validates that GradSim is an effective indicator of when knowledge ripples in LMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Can Knowledge Edit Methods Edit Perplexing Knowledge?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17253v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but updating their knowledge post-training remains a critical challenge. While recent model editing techniques like Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) show promise, their effectiveness may vary based on the nature of the knowledge being edited. We introduce the concept of ``perplexingness'': the degree to which new knowledge conflicts with an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies and categorical relationships. For instance, editing ``British Shorthair is a kind of cat'' to ``British Shorthair is a kind of dog'' represents a low-perplexingness edit within the same taxonomic level, while editing ``A cat is a kind of animal'' to ``A cat is a kind of plant'' represents a high-perplexingness edit that violates fundamental categorical boundaries. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we introduce HierarchyData, a carefully curated dataset of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories. Through controlled experiments across three models and four editing methods, we demonstrate a strong negative correlation between the perplexingness of new knowledge and the effectiveness of knowledge editing. Our analysis reveals that edits involving more abstract concepts (hypernyms) generally exhibit higher perplexingness and are more resistant to modification than their specific counterparts (hyponyms). These findings highlight a fundamental challenge in LLM knowledge editing: the more a new fact contradicts an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies, the harder it becomes to reliably encode that knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A previous version of this document contained a hidden prompt entered by Z Zhu without knowledge of -- or consent by -- his co-authors.

| **[Understanding Language Model Circuits through Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17241v4)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language model interpretability have identified circuits, critical subnetworks that replicate model behaviors, yet how knowledge is structured within these crucial subnetworks remains opaque. To gain an understanding toward the knowledge in the circuits, we conduct systematic knowledge editing experiments on the circuits of the GPT-2 language model. Our analysis reveals intriguing patterns in how circuits respond to editing attempts, the extent of knowledge distribution across network components, and the architectural composition of knowledge-bearing circuits. These findings offer insights into the complex relationship between model circuits and knowledge representation, deepening the understanding of how information is organized within language models. Our findings offer novel insights into the ``meanings'' of the circuits, and introduce directions for further interpretability and safety research of language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A previous version of this document contained a hidden prompt entered by Z Zhu without knowledge of -- or consent by -- his co-authors.

| **[An Exploration of Knowledge Editing for Arabic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09629v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Knowledge Editing (KE) has been widely explored in English, its behavior in morphologically rich languages like Arabic remains underexamined. In this work, we present the first study of Arabic KE. We evaluate four methods (ROME, MEMIT, ICE, and LTE) on Arabic translations of the ZsRE and Counterfact benchmarks, analyzing both multilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our experiments on Llama-2-7B-chat show show that parameter-based methods struggle with cross-lingual generalization, while instruction-tuned methods perform more robustly. We extend Learning-To-Edit (LTE) to a multilingual setting and show that joint Arabic-English training improves both editability and transfer. We release Arabic KE benchmarks and multilingual training for LTE data to support future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChainEdit: Propagating Ripple Effects in LLM Knowledge Editing through Logical Rule-Guided Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08427v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics, ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Principled Evaluation of Knowledge Editors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05937v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years. For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a constant blind spot. We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at L2M2 workshop at ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Uncovering Overfitting in Large Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07819v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has been proposed as an effective method for updating and correcting the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing editing methods often struggle with complex tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we identify and investigate the phenomenon of Editing Overfit, where edited models assign disproportionately high probabilities to the edit target, hindering the generalization of new knowledge in complex scenarios. We attribute this issue to the current editing paradigm, which places excessive emphasis on the direct correspondence between the input prompt and the edit target for each edit sample. To further explore this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, EVOKE (EValuation of Editing Overfit in Knowledge Editing), along with fine-grained evaluation metrics. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Editing Overfit is prevalent in current editing methods and that common overfitting mitigation strategies are ineffective in knowledge editing. To overcome this, inspired by LLMs' knowledge recall mechanisms, we propose a new plug-and-play strategy called Learn the Inference (LTI), which introduce a Multi-stage Inference Constraint module to guide the edited models in recalling new knowledge similarly to how unedited LLMs leverage knowledge through in-context learning. Extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks validate the effectiveness of LTI in mitigating Editing Overfit.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Position: Editing Large Language Models Poses Serious Safety Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02958v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) contain large amounts of facts about the world. These facts can become outdated over time, which has led to the development of knowledge editing methods (KEs) that can change specific facts in LLMs with limited side effects. This position paper argues that editing LLMs poses serious safety risks that have been largely overlooked. First, we note the fact that KEs are widely available, computationally inexpensive, highly performant, and stealthy makes them an attractive tool for malicious actors. Second, we discuss malicious use cases of KEs, showing how KEs can be easily adapted for a variety of malicious purposes. Third, we highlight vulnerabilities in the AI ecosystem that allow unrestricted uploading and downloading of updated models without verification. Fourth, we argue that a lack of social and institutional awareness exacerbates this risk, and discuss the implications for different stakeholders. We call on the community to (i) research tamper-resistant models and countermeasures against malicious model editing, and (ii) actively engage in securing the AI ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Model Merging for Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12384v1)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) require continuous updates to maintain accurate and current knowledge as the world evolves. While existing knowledge editing approaches offer various solutions for knowledge updating, they often struggle with sequential editing scenarios and harm the general capabilities of the model, thereby significantly hampering their practical applicability. This paper proposes a two-stage framework combining robust supervised fine-tuning (R-SFT) with model merging for knowledge editing. Our method first fine-tunes the LLM to internalize new knowledge fully, then merges the fine-tuned model with the original foundation model to preserve newly acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while better preserving the original performance of the model, all without requiring any architectural changes. Code is available at: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/MM4KE.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Mitigating Negative Interference in Multilingual Sequential Knowledge Editing through Null-Space Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10800v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs), while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces. This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks, demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/VRCMF/LangEdit.git.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Representation Shattering in Transformers: A Synthetic Study with Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17194v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing (KE) algorithms alter models' weights to perform targeted updates to incorrect, outdated, or otherwise unwanted factual associations. However, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affect models' broader factual recall accuracy and diminish their reasoning abilities. Although these studies give insights into the potential harms of KE algorithms, e.g., performance evaluations on benchmarks, little is understood about why such destructive failures occur. Motivated by this, we define a novel synthetic task in which a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a "structured" knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of the graph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on other entities (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X's siblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models on this task, we show that KE inadvertently affects representations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevant structures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. We call this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it degrades models' factual recall and reasoning performance. We further corroborate our findings in naturalistic settings with pre-trained Llama and Mamba models as well. Overall, our work yields a precise mechanistic hypothesis to explain why KE has adverse effects on model abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Is Fine-Tuning an Effective Solution? Reassessing Knowledge Editing for Unstructured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09672v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs, such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2) Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting (FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well, with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows, expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%</p></details> |  |
| **[PropMEND: Hypernetworks for Knowledge Propagation in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08920v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating knowledge to a wide range of relations.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[BalancEdit: Dynamically Balancing the Generality-Locality Trade-off in Multi-modal Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01343v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts update and previously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as fine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size and complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a more viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically overlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised model performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT, specifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this foundation, we propose \textbf{BalancEdit}, a novel method for balanced model editing that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete, localized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To our knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive results confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal trade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/donglgcn/BalancEdit/tree/MMOKVQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lifelong Evolution: Collaborative Learning between Large and Small Language Models for Continuous Emergent Fake News Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04739v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges. The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods, effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous emergent fake news scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Memorization: A Rigorous Evaluation Framework for Medical Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03490v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a promising approach to update specific facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for full retraining. Despite the effectiveness in general-domain benchmarks, their applicability to complex medical domain remains largely unexplored. Medical knowledge editing is particularly challenging, as it requires LLMs to internalize the knowledge and generalize to unseen scenarios for effective and interpretable decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel framework called MedEditBench to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of existing KE methods in the medical domain. In MedEditBench, we introduce a new medical knowledge editing benchmark as well as three different knowledge editing paradigms, which are designed to assess the impact of different knowledge sources for editing. Our findings indicate that current KE methods result in only superficial memorization of the injected information, failing to generalize to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit), which utilizes model-derived rationales as the target knowledge for editing, thereby uncovering the underlying reasoning process and demonstrating significant improvements over existing KE approaches. Additionally, we offer deeper insights into medical knowledge editing, including the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This could provide practical guidance for implementing KE methods in real-world medical applications.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[MobiEdit: Resource-efficient Knowledge Editing for Personalized On-device LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13772v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are deployed on mobile devices to power killer applications such as intelligent assistants. LLMs pre-trained on general corpora often hallucinate when handling personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect or outdated responses. Knowledge editing addresses this by identifying and adjusting a small crucial portion of model weights, without compromising the general knowledge. However, prior knowledge editing methods are impractical to run on local devices due to the resource-heavy backpropagation (BP) needed for updates. We present MobiEdit, the first mobile knowledge editing framework that enables efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. MobiEdit replaces full-precision BP with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, thus compatible with the energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). MobiEdit replaces full-precision backpropagation with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile NPUs. To further improve gradient estimation efficiency, we introduce two optimizations: an early stoping mechanism that adaptively terminates editing upon success and a prefix cache that reuses computation across steps. Our approach enables real-time editing of a 3B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) on COTS mobile devices with 7.6$\times$ less memory, 14.7 $\times$ less energy and 3.6$\times$ less latency compared to previous knowledge editing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Knowledge Editing via Minimal Precomputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04226v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a "precomputation step", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling and Eliminating the Shortcut Learning for Locate-Then-Edit Knowledge Editing via Both Subject and Relation Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04042v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing aims to alternate the target knowledge predicted by large language models while ensuring the least side effects on unrelated knowledge. An effective way to achieve knowledge editing is to identify pivotal parameters for predicting factual associations and modify them with an optimization process to update the predictions. However, these locate-then-edit methods are uncontrollable since they tend to modify most unrelated relations connected to the subject of target editing. We unveil that this failure of controllable editing is due to a shortcut learning issue during the optimization process. Specifically, we discover two crucial features that are the subject feature and the relation feature for models to learn during optimization, but the current optimization process tends to over-learning the subject feature while neglecting the relation feature. To eliminate this shortcut learning of the subject feature, we propose a novel two-stage optimization process that balances the learning of the subject feature and the relation feature. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully prevents knowledge editing from shortcut learning and achieves the optimal overall performance, contributing to controllable knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00829v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios, particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological and model-specific perspectives.

Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection. However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g., recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) -- which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based ("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question) evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a challenging task. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/asdfo123/ScEdit.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

This leaves the broader role of neuron activations unclear, limiting progress in areas like knowledge editing. We uncover a global linear relationship between neuron activations and outputs using neuron interventions on a knowledge probing dataset. The gradient of this linear relationship, which we call the neuron empirical gradient (NEG), captures how changes in activations affect predictions. To compute NEG efficiently, we propose NeurGrad, enabling large-scale analysis of neuron behavior in PLMs. We also show that NEG effectively captures language skills across diverse prompts through skill neuron probing. Experiments on MCEval8k, a multi-genre multiple-choice knowledge benchmark, support NEG's ability to represent model knowledge. Further analysis highlights the key properties of NEG-based skill representation: efficiency, robustness, flexibility, and interdependency.

However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving.

However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese.

| **[One for All: Update Parameterized Knowledge Across Multiple Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00817v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances, ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models. Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing.

| **[Decoupling Reasoning and Knowledge Injection for In-Context Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00536v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end, we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency. Our code is available at: https://github.com/bebr2/DecKER .</p></details> |  |

Cross-lingual KE, which requires knowledge edited in one language to generalize across others while preserving unrelated knowledge, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate IKE under zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot setups, incorporating tailored metric-specific demonstrations. Our findings reveal that model scale and demonstration alignment critically govern cross-lingual IKE efficacy, with larger models and tailored demonstrations significantly improving performance. Linguistic properties, particularly script type, strongly influence performance variation across languages, with non-Latin languages underperforming due to issues like language confusion.

| **[Context-Robust Knowledge Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23026v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge. This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence editing success.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Findings.

| **[LLLMs: A Data-Driven Survey of Evolving Research on Limitations of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19240v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) research has grown rapidly, along with increasing concern about their limitations such as failures in reasoning, hallucinations, and limited multilingual capability. While prior reviews have addressed these issues, they often focus on individual limitations or consider them within the broader context of evaluating overall model performance. This survey addresses the gap by presenting a data-driven, semi-automated review of research on limitations of LLMs (LLLMs) from 2022 to 2025, using a bottom-up approach. From a corpus of 250,000 ACL and arXiv papers, we extract 14,648 relevant limitation papers using keyword filtering and LLM-based classification, validated against expert labels. Using topic clustering (via two approaches, HDBSCAN+BERTopic and LlooM), we identify between 7 and 15 prominent types of limitations discussed in recent LLM research across the ACL and arXiv datasets. We find that LLM-related research increases nearly sixfold in ACL and nearly fifteenfold in arXiv between 2022 and 2025, while LLLMs research grows even faster, by a factor of over 12 in ACL and nearly 28 in arXiv. Reasoning remains the most studied limitation, followed by generalization, hallucination, bias, and security. The distribution of topics in the ACL dataset stays relatively stable over time, while arXiv shifts toward safety and controllability (with topics like security risks, alignment, hallucinations, knowledge editing), and multimodality between 2022 and 2025. We offer a quantitative view of trends in LLM limitations research and release a dataset of annotated abstracts and a validated methodology, available at: https://github.com/a-kostikova/LLLMs-Survey.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel framework for implicit knowledge editing and controlled text generation by fine-tuning LLMs with a prototype-based contrastive perplexity objective. Central to our method is the construction of hard negatives - toxic outputs that are generated through adversarial paraphrasing to be semantically similar and model probability to their non-toxic counterparts. By training on these challenging and realistic pairs, our approach ensures robust and stable contrastive optimization. Experimental results in the domain of detoxification demonstrate that our method significantly reduces toxic generation while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks such as commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of exploiting hard negatives for attribute-aware fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Track)</p></details> |
| **[ConKE: Conceptualization-Augmented Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11418v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing (KE) aims to adjust a Large Language Model's (LLM) internal representations and parameters to correct inaccuracies and improve output consistency without incurring the computational expense of re-training the entire model. However, editing commonsense knowledge still faces difficulties, including limited knowledge coverage in existing resources, the infeasibility of annotating labels for an overabundance of commonsense knowledge, and the strict knowledge formats of current editing methods. In this paper, we address these challenges by presenting ConceptEdit, a framework that integrates conceptualization and instantiation into the KE pipeline for LLMs to enhance their commonsense reasoning capabilities. ConceptEdit dynamically diagnoses implausible commonsense knowledge within an LLM using another verifier LLM and augments the source knowledge to be edited with conceptualization for stronger generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with ConceptEdit successfully generate commonsense knowledge with improved plausibility compared to other baselines and achieve stronger performance across multiple question answering benchmarks. Our data, code, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/ConKE.</p></details> | Findings of ACL2025 |
| **[Adaptive Detoxification: Safeguarding General Capabilities of LLMs through Toxicity-Aware Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22298v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive language capabilities but remain vulnerable to malicious prompts and jailbreaking attacks. Existing knowledge editing methods for LLM detoxification face two major challenges. First, they often rely on entity-specific localization, making them ineffective against adversarial inputs without explicit entities. Second, these methods suffer from over-editing, where detoxified models reject legitimate queries, compromising overall performance. In this paper, we propose ToxEdit, a toxicity-aware knowledge editing approach that dynamically detects toxic activation patterns during forward propagation. It then routes computations through adaptive inter-layer pathways to mitigate toxicity effectively. This design ensures precise toxicity mitigation while preserving LLMs' general capabilities. To more accurately assess over-editing, we also enhance the SafeEdit benchmark by incorporating instruction-following evaluation tasks. Experimental results on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our ToxEdit outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both detoxification performance and safeguarding general capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Mitigating Heterogeneous Token Overfitting in LLM Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00602v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various natural language tasks. However, they are trained on static corpora and their knowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This motivates the development of knowledge editing (KE) to update specific knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others or compromising their pre-trained capabilities. Previous efforts sought to update a small amount of parameters of a LLM and proved effective for making selective updates. Nonetheless, the edited LLM often exhibits degraded ability to reason about the new knowledge. In this work, we identify a key issue: heterogeneous token overfitting (HTO), where the LLM overfits different tokens in the provided knowledge at varying rates. To tackle this, we propose OVERTONE, a token-level smoothing method that mitigates HTO by adaptively refining the target distribution. Theoretically, OVERTONE offers better parameter updates with negligible computation overhead. It also induces an implicit DPO but does not require preference data pairs. Extensive experiments across four editing methods, two LLMs, and diverse scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Tracing and Reversing Rank-One Model Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20819v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing methods (KEs) are a cost-effective way to update the factual content of large language models (LLMs), but they pose a dual-use risk. While KEs are beneficial for updating outdated or incorrect information, they can be exploited maliciously to implant misinformation or bias. In order to defend against these types of malicious manipulation, we need robust techniques that can reliably detect, interpret, and mitigate adversarial edits. This work investigates the traceability and reversibility of knowledge edits, focusing on the widely used Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) method. We first show that ROME introduces distinctive distributional patterns in the edited weight matrices, which can serve as effective signals for locating the edited weights. Second, we show that these altered weights can reliably be used to predict the edited factual relation, enabling partial reconstruction of the modified fact. Building on this, we propose a method to infer the edited object entity directly from the modified weights, without access to the editing prompt, achieving over 95% accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ROME edits can be reversed, recovering the model's original outputs with $\geq$ 80% accuracy. Our findings highlight the feasibility of detecting, tracing, and reversing edits based on the edited weights, offering a robust framework for safeguarding LLMs against adversarial manipulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoEdit: Geometric Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19953v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regular updates are essential for maintaining up-to-date knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Consequently, various model editing methods have been developed to update specific knowledge within LLMs. However, training-based approaches often struggle to effectively incorporate new knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Geometric Knowledge Editing (GeoEdit). GeoEdit utilizes the geometric relationships of parameter updates from fine-tuning to differentiate between neurons associated with new knowledge updates and those related to general knowledge perturbations. By employing a direction-aware knowledge identification method, we avoid updating neurons with directions approximately orthogonal to existing knowledge, thus preserving the model's generalization ability. For the remaining neurons, we integrate both old and new knowledge for aligned directions and apply a "forget-then-learn" editing strategy for opposite directions. Additionally, we introduce an importance-guided task vector fusion technique that filters out redundant information and provides adaptive neuron-level weighting, further enhancing model editing performance. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoEdit over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Editing as Unlearning: Are Knowledge Editing Methods Strong Baselines for Large Language Model Unlearning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19855v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language Model (LLM) unlearning, i.e., selectively removing information from LLMs, is vital for responsible model deployment. Differently, LLM knowledge editing aims to modify LLM knowledge instead of removing it. Though editing and unlearning seem to be two distinct tasks, we find there is a tight connection between them. In this paper, we conceptualize unlearning as a special case of editing where information is modified to a refusal or "empty set" $\emptyset$ response, signifying its removal. This paper thus investigates if knowledge editing techniques are strong baselines for LLM unlearning. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) editing methods (e.g., ROME, MEMIT, GRACE, WISE, and AlphaEdit) against existing unlearning approaches on pretrained and finetuned knowledge. Results show certain editing methods, notably WISE and AlphaEdit, are effective unlearning baselines, especially for pretrained knowledge, and excel in generating human-aligned refusal answers. To better adapt editing methods for unlearning applications, we propose practical recipes including self-improvement and query merging. The former leverages the LLM's own in-context learning ability to craft a more human-aligned unlearning target, and the latter enables ROME and MEMIT to perform well in unlearning longer sample sequences. We advocate for the unlearning community to adopt SOTA editing methods as baselines and explore unlearning from an editing perspective for more holistic LLM memory control.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[CaseEdit: Enhancing Localized Commonsense Reasoning via Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing in Small Parameter Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19383v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance on factual recall and general reasoning but struggle to adapt to user-specific, commonsense knowledge, a challenge particularly acute in small-parameter settings where computational efficiency is prioritized. We introduce CaseEdit, a new dataset and generation pipeline for evaluating localized, personalized commonsense knowledge editing in small LLMs to address this. Built upon the ATOMIC20/20 commonsense graph, CaseEdit uses a multi-stage inference process to generate both typical and atypical contextual edits for household objects, paired with targeted evaluation questions across four axes: reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. We evaluate established knowledge editing methods using CaseEdit and demonstrate that AlphaEdit, a technique employing null-space projection to minimize interference with unrelated knowledge, consistently outperforms other methods when applied to an LLaMA 3.2 3B model, even in scalability tests, showing minimal ripple effects. Our results indicate that using CaseEdit with effective editing techniques like AlphaEdit allows small models to internalize high-quality, context-sensitive common-sense knowledge, paving the way for lightweight, personalized assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Knowledge Editing Types in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19663v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient technique for updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs), attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of effective measures to prevent the malicious misuse of this technique, which could lead to harmful edits in LLMs. These malicious modifications could cause LLMs to generate toxic content, misleading users into inappropriate actions. In front of this risk, we introduce a new task, $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{T}$ype $\textbf{I}$dentification (KETI), aimed at identifying different types of edits in LLMs, thereby providing timely alerts to users when encountering illicit edits. As part of this task, we propose KETIBench, which includes five types of harmful edits covering the most popular toxic types, as well as one benign factual edit. We develop five classical classification models and three BERT-based models as baseline identifiers for both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our experimental results, across 92 trials involving four models and three knowledge editing methods, demonstrate that all eight baseline identifiers achieve decent identification performance, highlighting the feasibility of identifying malicious edits in LLMs. Additional analyses reveal that the performance of the identifiers is independent of the reliability of the knowledge editing methods and exhibits cross-domain generalization, enabling the identification of edits from unknown sources. All data and code are available in https://github.com/xpq-tech/KETI.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

To address this challenge, we introduce REACT (Representation Extraction And Controllable Tuning), a unified two-phase framework designed for precise and controllable knowledge editing. In the initial phase, we utilize tailored stimuli to extract latent factual representations and apply Principal Component Analysis with a simple learnbale linear transformation to compute a directional "belief shift" vector for each instance. In the second phase, we apply controllable perturbations to hidden states using the obtained vector with a magnitude scalar, gated by a pre-trained classifier that permits edits only when contextually necessary. Relevant experiments on EVOKE benchmarks demonstrate that REACT significantly reduces overfitting across nearly all evaluation metrics, and experiments on COUNTERFACT and MQuAKE shows that our method preserves balanced basic editing performance (reliability, locality, and generality) under diverse editing scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Disentangling Knowledge Representations for Large Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18774v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing has emerged as a promising solution for efficiently updating embedded knowledge in large language models (LLMs). While existing approaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and preserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain fine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited knowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because subject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the target and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the representation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during editing. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles Knowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key components: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that decomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and -unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module that updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the unrelated one. We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based on matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits. To rigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we construct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant knowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially improves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining competitive general editing performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches, whether through parameter modification or external memory integration, often suffer from inconsistent evaluation objectives and experimental setups. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study. In addition to fact-level datasets, we introduce more complex event-based datasets and general-purpose datasets drawn from other tasks. Our evaluation covers both instruction-tuned and reasoning-oriented LLMs, under a realistic autoregressive inference setting rather than teacher-forced decoding. Beyond single-edit assessments, we also evaluate multi-edit scenarios to better reflect practical demands. We employ four evaluation dimensions, including portability, and compare all recent methods against a simple and straightforward baseline named Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR). Empirical results reveal that parameter-based editing methods perform poorly under realistic conditions. In contrast, SCR consistently outperforms them across all settings. This study offers new insights into the limitations of current knowledge editing methods and highlights the potential of context-based reasoning as a more robust alternative.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.05212</p></details> |

Existing defense mechanisms have not fully deleted harmful knowledge in LLMs, which allows such attacks to bypass safeguards and produce harmful outputs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel safety alignment strategy, Constrained Knowledge Unlearning (CKU), which focuses on two primary objectives: knowledge localization and retention, and unlearning harmful knowledge. CKU works by scoring neurons in specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance, offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing methods. Additionally, our analysis of neuron knowledge sensitivity across various MLP layers provides valuable insights into the mechanics of safety alignment and model knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edit Once, Update Everywhere: A Simple Framework for Cross-Lingual Knowledge Synchronization in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14645v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing allows for efficient adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to new information or corrections without requiring full retraining. However, prior methods typically focus on either single-language editing or basic multilingual editing, failing to achieve true cross-linguistic knowledge synchronization. To address this, we present a simple and practical state-of-the-art (SOTA) recipe Cross-Lingual Knowledge Democracy Edit (X-KDE), designed to propagate knowledge from a dominant language to other languages effectively. Our X-KDE comprises two stages: (i) Cross-lingual Edition Instruction Tuning (XE-IT), which fine-tunes the model on a curated parallel dataset to modify in-scope knowledge while preserving unrelated information, and (ii) Target-language Preference Optimization (TL-PO), which applies advanced optimization techniques to ensure consistency across languages, fostering the transfer of updates. Additionally, we contribute a high-quality, cross-lingual dataset, specifically designed to enhance knowledge transfer across languages. Extensive experiments on the Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks show that X-KDE significantly enhances cross-lingual performance, achieving an average improvement of +8.19%, while maintaining high accuracy in monolingual settings.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

Currently, most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories, utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity. Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.</p></details> | <details><summary>UniEd...</summary><p>UniEdit Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/qizhou/UniEdit Code: https://github.com/qizhou000/UniEdit</p></details> |

However, traditional prompt-based techniques for controlling personality often fall short, as they do not effectively mitigate the model's inherent biases. In this paper, we introduce a novel method PALETTE that enhances personality control through knowledge editing. By generating adjustment queries inspired by psychological assessments, our approach systematically adjusts responses to personality-related queries similar to modifying factual knowledge, thereby achieving controlled shifts in personality traits. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our method enables more stable and well-balanced personality control in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 24 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we formalize the popular locate-then-edit methods as a two-step fine-tuning process, allowing us to precisely identify the root cause of this degradation. We show that model degradation occurs due to (1) over-optimization of internal activations and (2) continuous norm-growth of edited matrices. To mitigate these issues, we introduce two regularization techniques: (1) Most-Probable Early Stopping (MPES) and (2) explicit Frobenius norm-constraint. We demonstrate that applying these simple yet effective regularization techniques at key points in the editing process can substantially mitigate model degradation. Combining these regularization methods enables scaling locate-then-edit methods to 10,000 edits while reducing editing time by 42-61%. These results show that targeted regularization is essential for lifelong knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |

Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper introduces the concept of "superficial editing" to describe this phenomenon. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices, encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and conclusions.

However, existing sequential editing methods suffer from a significant decline in editing success rates after long-term editing. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we identify that as the number of edits increases, the model's output increasingly deviates from the desired target, leading to a drop in editing success rates. We refer to this issue as the accumulation of superimposed noise problem. To address this, we identify the factors contributing to this deviation and propose DeltaEdit, a novel method that optimizes update parameters through a dynamic orthogonal constraints strategy, effectively reducing interference between edits to mitigate deviation. Experimental results demonstrate that DeltaEdit significantly outperforms existing methods in edit success rates and the retention of generalization capabilities, ensuring stable and reliable model performance even under extensive sequential editing.</p></details> |  |

Traditional updating methods, like fine-tuning and incremental learning, face challenges such as overfitting and high computational costs.

We identify the prevalence of KEO in existing KE datasets and show its significant impact on current KE methods, causing performance degradation in handling such triplets. To address this, we propose a new formulation, Knowledge Set Editing (KSE), and introduce SetKE, a method that edits sets of triplets simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that SetKE outperforms existing methods in KEO scenarios on mainstream LLMs. Additionally, we introduce EditSet, a dataset containing KEO triplets, providing a comprehensive benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>The C...</summary><p>The CR version will be updated subsequently</p></details> |

Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.7% with a single line of additional code for projection solely.

| **[Functional Abstraction of Knowledge Recall in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14496v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained transformer large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong knowledge recall capabilities. This paper investigates the knowledge recall mechanism in LLMs by abstracting it into a functional structure. We propose that during knowledge recall, the model's hidden activation space implicitly entails a function execution process where specific activation vectors align with functional components (Input argument, Function body, and Return values). Specifically, activation vectors of relation-related tokens define a mapping function from subjects to objects, with subject-related token activations serving as input arguments and object-related token activations as return values. For experimental verification, we first design a patching-based knowledge-scoring algorithm to identify knowledge-aware activation vectors as independent functional components. Then, we conduct counter-knowledge testing to examine the independent functional effects of each component on knowledge recall outcomes. From this functional perspective, we improve the contextual knowledge editing approach augmented by activation patching. By rewriting incoherent activations in context, we enable improved short-term memory retention for new knowledge prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Edit LLMs for Long-Tail Biomedical Knowledge?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10421v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has emerged as an effective approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by modifying their internal knowledge. However, their application to the biomedical domain faces unique challenges due to the long-tailed distribution of biomedical knowledge, where rare and infrequent information is prevalent. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study to investigate the effectiveness of knowledge editing methods for editing long-tail biomedical knowledge. Our results indicate that, while existing editing methods can enhance LLMs' performance on long-tail biomedical knowledge, their performance on long-tail knowledge remains inferior to that on high-frequency popular knowledge, even after editing. Our further analysis reveals that long-tail biomedical knowledge contains a significant amount of one-to-many knowledge, where one subject and relation link to multiple objects. This high prevalence of one-to-many knowledge limits the effectiveness of knowledge editing in improving LLMs' understanding of long-tail biomedical knowledge, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to bridge this performance gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Make LLMs Forget: On Reversing In-Context Knowledge Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12586v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context knowledge editing (IKE) enables efficient modification of large language model (LLM) outputs without parameter changes and at zero-cost. However, it can be misused to manipulate responses opaquely, e.g., insert misinformation or offensive content. Such malicious interventions could be incorporated into high-level wrapped APIs where the final input prompt is not shown to end-users. To address this issue, we investigate the detection and reversal of IKE-edits. First, we demonstrate that IKE-edits can be detected with high accuracy (F1 > 80\%) using only the top-10 output probabilities of the next token, even in a black-box setting, e.g. proprietary LLMs with limited output information. Further, we introduce the novel task of reversing IKE-edits using specially tuned reversal tokens. We explore using both continuous and discrete reversal tokens, achieving over 80\% accuracy in recovering original, unedited outputs across multiple LLMs. Our continuous reversal tokens prove particularly effective, with minimal impact on unedited prompts. Through analysis of output distributions, attention patterns, and token rankings, we provide insights into IKE's effects on LLMs and how reversal tokens mitigate them. This work represents a significant step towards enhancing LLM resilience against potential misuse of in-context editing, improving their transparency and trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</p></details> |
| **[CodeUpdateArena: Benchmarking Knowledge Editing on API Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06249v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to synthesize and reason about source code. However, the static nature of these models' knowledge does not reflect the fact that libraries and API functions they invoke are continuously evolving, with functionality being added or changing. While numerous benchmarks evaluate how LLMs can generate code, no prior work has studied how an LLMs' knowledge about code API functions can be updated. To fill this gap, we present CodeUpdateArena, a benchmark for knowledge editing in the code domain. An instance in our benchmark consists of a synthetic API function update paired with a program synthesis example that uses the updated functionality; our goal is to update an LLM to be able to solve this program synthesis example without providing documentation of the update at inference time. Compared to knowledge editing for facts encoded in text, success here is more challenging: a code LLM must correctly reason about the semantics of the modified function rather than just reproduce its syntax. Our dataset is constructed by first prompting GPT-4 to generate atomic and executable function updates. Then, for each update, we generate program synthesis examples whose code solutions are prone to use the update. Our benchmark covers updates of various types to 54 functions from seven diverse Python packages, with a total of 670 program synthesis examples. Our experiments show that prepending documentation of the update to open-source code LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek, CodeLlama) does not allow them to incorporate changes for problem solving, and existing knowledge editing techniques also have substantial room for improvement. We hope our benchmark will inspire new methods for knowledge updating in code LLMs.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[$μ$KE: Matryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01196v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge bases yet are limited by static training data, leading to issues such as hallucinations and safety risks. Editing a model's internal knowledge through the locate-and-edit paradigm has proven a cost-effective alternative to retraining, though current unstructured approaches, especially window-based autoregressive methods, often disrupt the causal dependency between early memory updates and later output tokens. In this work, we first theoretically analyze these limitations and then introduce Matryoshka Unstructured Knowledge Editing ($\mu$KE), a novel memory update mechanism that preserves such dependencies via a Matryoshka-style objective and adaptive loss coefficients. Empirical evaluations on two models across four benchmarks demonstrate that $\mu$KE improves edit efficacy by up to 12.33% over state-of-the-art methods, and remain robust when applied to diverse formatted edits, underscoring its potential for effective unstructured knowledge editing in LLMs.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[In-Context Editing: Learning Knowledge from Self-Induced Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11194v4)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In scenarios where language models must incorporate new information efficiently without extensive retraining, traditional fine-tuning methods are prone to overfitting, degraded generalization, and unnatural language generation. To address these limitations, we introduce Consistent In-Context Editing (ICE), a novel approach leveraging the model's in-context learning capability to optimize toward a contextual distribution rather than a one-hot target. ICE introduces a simple yet effective optimization framework for the model to internalize new knowledge by aligning its output distributions with and without additional context. This method enhances the robustness and effectiveness of gradient-based tuning methods, preventing overfitting and preserving the model's integrity. We analyze ICE across four critical aspects of knowledge editing: accuracy, locality, generalization, and linguistic quality, demonstrating its advantages. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of ICE and demonstrate its potential for continual editing, ensuring that the integrity of the model is preserved while updating information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Multi-modal Knowledge Neurons in Pretrained Transformers via Two-stage Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22941v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. Although these models allow for integrated visual and language understanding, they present challenges such as opaque internal processing and the generation of hallucinations and misinformation. Therefore, there is a need for a method to clarify the location of knowledge in MLLMs. In this study, we propose a method to identify neurons associated with specific knowledge using MiniGPT-4, a Transformer-based MLLM. Specifically, we extract knowledge neurons through two stages: activation differences filtering using inpainting and gradient-based filtering using GradCAM. Experiments on the image caption generation task using the MS COCO 2017 dataset, BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore quantitative evaluation, and qualitative evaluation using an activation heatmap showed that our method is able to locate knowledge with higher accuracy than existing methods. This study contributes to the visualization and explainability of knowledge in MLLMs and shows the potential for future knowledge editing and control.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnyEdit: Edit Any Knowledge Encoded in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05628v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |

While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This paper strategically identifies the need for linguistic equity by examining several knowledge editing techniques in multilingual contexts. We evaluate the performance of models such as Mistral, TowerInstruct, OpenHathi, Tamil-Llama, and Kan-Llama across languages including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Our research identifies significant discrepancies in normal and merged models concerning cross-lingual consistency. We employ strategies like 'each language for itself' (ELFI) and 'each language for others' (ELFO) to stress-test these models. Our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to overcome linguistic barriers, laying the groundwork for future research in achieving linguistic inclusivity in AI technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 (Industry track)</p></details> |
| **[Precise Localization of Memories: A Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing Technique for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01090v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing aims to update outdated information in Large Language Models (LLMs). A representative line of study is locate-then-edit methods, which typically employ causal tracing to identify the modules responsible for recalling factual knowledge about entities. However, we find these methods are often sensitive only to changes in the subject entity, leaving them less effective at adapting to changes in relations. This limitation results in poor editing locality, which can lead to the persistence of irrelevant or inaccurate facts, ultimately compromising the reliability of LLMs. We believe this issue arises from the insufficient precision of knowledge localization. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Neuron-level Knowledge Editing (FiNE) method that enhances editing locality without affecting overall success rates. By precisely identifying and modifying specific neurons within feed-forward networks, FiNE significantly improves knowledge localization and editing. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that FiNE efficiently achieves better overall performance compared to existing techniques, providing new insights into the localization and modification of knowledge within LLMs.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Composable Interventions for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06483v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time interventions for language models can enhance factual accuracy, mitigate harmful outputs, and improve model efficiency without costly retraining. But despite a flood of new methods, different types of interventions are largely developing independently. In practice, multiple interventions must be applied sequentially to the same model, yet we lack standardized ways to study how interventions interact. We fill this gap by introducing composable interventions, a framework to study the effects of using multiple interventions on the same language models, featuring new metrics and a unified codebase. Using our framework, we conduct extensive experiments and compose popular methods from three emerging intervention categories -- Knowledge Editing, Model Compression, and Machine Unlearning. Our results from 310 different compositions uncover meaningful interactions: compression hinders editing and unlearning, composing interventions hinges on their order of application, and popular general-purpose metrics are inadequate for assessing composability. Taken together, our findings showcase clear gaps in composability, suggesting a need for new multi-objective interventions.

| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Continuous Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03279v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without the need for costly retraining. Lifelong model editing is the most challenging task that caters to the continuous editing requirements of LLMs. Prior works primarily focus on single or batch editing; nevertheless, these methods fall short in lifelong editing scenarios due to catastrophic knowledge forgetting and the degradation of model performance. Although retrieval-based methods alleviate these issues, they are impeded by slow and cumbersome processes of integrating the retrieved knowledge into the model. In this work, we introduce RECIPE, a RetriEval-augmented ContInuous Prompt lEarning method, to boost editing efficacy and inference efficiency in lifelong learning. RECIPE first converts knowledge statements into short and informative continuous prompts, prefixed to the LLM's input query embedding, to efficiently refine the response grounded on the knowledge. It further integrates the Knowledge Sentinel (KS) that acts as an intermediary to calculate a dynamic threshold, determining whether the retrieval repository contains relevant knowledge. Our retriever and prompt encoder are jointly trained to achieve editing properties, i.e., reliability, generality, and locality. In our experiments, RECIPE is assessed extensively across multiple LLMs and editing datasets, where it achieves superior editing performance. RECIPE also demonstrates its capability to maintain the overall performance of LLMs alongside showcasing fast editing and inference speed.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 main |

This task poses challenges in lifelong scenarios where edits must be continuously applied for real-world applications. While some editors demonstrate strong robustness for lifelong editing in pure LLMs, Vision LLMs (VLLMs), which incorporate an additional vision modality, are not directly adaptable to existing LLM editors. In this paper, we propose LiveEdit, a LIfelong Vision language modEl Edit to bridge the gap between lifelong LLM editing and VLLMs. We begin by training an editing expert generator to independently produce low-rank experts for each editing instance, with the goal of correcting the relevant responses of the VLLM. A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge, thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally, to integrate visually relevant experts, we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation, we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios. Further experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of each module design in LiveEdit.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Accepted |

Knowledge editing offers a promising alternative, but methods are only tested on small-scale or synthetic edit benchmarks. In this work, we aim to bridge research into lifelong knowledge editing to real-world edits at practically relevant scale. We first introduce WikiBigEdit; a large-scale benchmark of real-world Wikidata edits, built to automatically extend lifelong for future-proof benchmarking. In its first instance, it includes over 500K question-answer pairs for knowledge editing alongside a comprehensive evaluation pipeline. Finally, we use WikiBigEdit to study existing knowledge editing techniques' ability to incorporate large volumes of real-world facts and contrast their capabilities to generic modification techniques such as retrieval augmentation and continual finetuning to acquire a complete picture of the practical extent of current lifelong knowledge editing.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, most existing methods overfit to specific models, causing edited knowledge to be discarded during each LLM update and requiring frequent re-editing, which is particularly burdensome in today's rapidly evolving open-source community. To address this issue, we propose the problem of cross-model knowledge editing and introduce MindBridge, a scalable solution inspired by the low coupling between modality processing and LLMs in multi-modal models. MindBridge introduces the novel concept of memory modality, which encodes edited knowledge as an independent modality. It first performs LLM-agnostic pre-training of the memory modality and then integrates it with various LLMs. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs and popular knowledge editing datasets demonstrate that MindBridge achieves superior performance even in editing tens of thousands of knowledge entries and can flexibly adapt to different LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/CrashBugger/MindBridge.</p></details> |  |

Designed with these constraints in mind, Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches propose to alter specific facts in pretrained models. However, they have been shown to suffer from several limitations, including their lack of contextual robustness and their failure to generalize to logical implications related to the fact. To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, a common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure that LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate progress in the field of knowledge editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal knowledge editing primarily focus on entity-level knowledge represented as simple triplets, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world multimodal information. To address this issue, we introduce MMKE-Bench, a comprehensive MultiModal Knowledge Editing Benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to edit diverse visual knowledge in real-world scenarios. MMKE-Bench addresses these limitations by incorporating three types of editing tasks: visual entity editing, visual semantic editing, and user-specific editing. Besides, MMKE-Bench uses free-form natural language to represent and edit knowledge, offering a more flexible and effective format. The benchmark consists of 2,940 pieces of knowledge and 8,363 images across 33 broad categories, with evaluation questions automatically generated and human-verified. We assess five state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods on three prominent LMMs, revealing that no method excels across all criteria, and that visual and user-specific edits are particularly challenging. MMKE-Bench sets a new standard for evaluating the robustness of multimodal knowledge editing techniques, driving progress in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ICLR2025.

However, they are trained on static corpora and their knowledge can become outdated quickly in the fast-changing world. This motivates the development of knowledge editing methods designed to update certain knowledge in LLMs without changing unrelated others. To make selective edits, previous efforts often sought to update a small amount of parameters in some specific layer(s) of a LLM. Nonetheless, in challenging scenarios, they still fall short in making successful edits while preserving knowledge irrelevant to the updates simultaneously, resulting in a notable editing-locality trade-off. In this work, we question if the trade-offs are caused by the fact that parameter-based updates have a global effect, i.e., edited parameters affect all inputs indiscriminately. In light of this, we explore the feasibility of representation fine-tuning, which applied some linear update to a few representations in a learned subspace, for knowledge editing. While being effective to enhance an LLM's general ability as demonstrated in the previous work, we theoretically show that this linear update imposes a tension in editing-locality trade-off. Subsequently, BaFT is proposed to break the linearity. BaFT computes a weight for each basis that spans a dimension of the subspace based on the input representation. This input-dependent weighting mechanism allows BaFT to manage different types of knowledge in an adaptive way, thereby achieving a better editing-locality trade-off. Experiments on three LLMs with five editing benchmarks in diverse scenarios show the superiority of our method.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Most editing works achieve knowledge editing under the guidance of existing interpretations of knowledge recall that mainly focus on subject knowledge. However, these interpretations are seriously flawed, neglecting relation information and leading to the over-generalizing problem for editing. In this work, we discover a novel relation-focused perspective to interpret the knowledge recall of transformer LMs during inference and apply it on single knowledge editing to avoid over-generalizing. Experimental results on the dataset supplemented with a new R-Specificity criterion demonstrate that our editing approach significantly alleviates over-generalizing while remaining competitive on other criteria, breaking the domination of subject-focused editing for future research.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |

Knowledge-based model editing enables precise modifications to the weights of large language models in order to modify the information encoded within. Recent approaches have seen success in enabling recall of edited information for thousands of edits at once. However, these approaches fail to produce edits that account for associated contextual information. We present K-Edit, an effective approach to generating contextually consistent knowledge edits. By using knowledge graphs, which maintain contextual consistency when an edge is edited, we are able to generate additional \textit{contextual edits} that ensure consistency of related information in the language model. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in multi-hop question answering while maintaining the general effectiveness and scalability of model edits.</p></details> |  |

We first show that across different post-training interventions like continuous pre-training, full fine-tuning and LORA-based fine-tuning, the Frobenius norm of the updated matrices always increases. This increasing norm is especially detrimental for localized knowledge editing, where only a subset of matrices are updated in a model . We reveal a consistent phenomenon across various editing techniques, including fine-tuning, hypernetwork-based approaches, and locate-and-edit methods: the norm of the updated matrix invariably increases with successive updates. Such growth disrupts model balance, particularly when isolated matrices are updated while the rest of the model remains static, leading to potential instability and degradation of downstream performance. Upon deeper investigations of the intermediate activation vectors, we find that the norm of internal activations decreases and is accompanied by shifts in the subspaces occupied by these activations, which shows that these activation vectors now occupy completely different regions in the representation space compared to the unedited model. With our paper, we highlight the technical challenges with continuous and localized sequential knowledge editing and their implications for maintaining model stability and utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Oral Presentation at KnowFM @ AAAI 2025. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.01636</p></details> |

However, current knowledge editing methods have limited scalability for lifelong editing. This study explores the fundamental reason why knowledge editing fails in lifelong editing. We begin with the closed-form solution derived from linear associative memory, which underpins state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods. We extend the solution from single editing to lifelong editing, and through rigorous mathematical derivation, identify an interference term in the final solution, suggesting that editing knowledge may impact irrelevant knowledge. Further analysis of the interference term reveals a close relationship with superposition between knowledge representations. When knowledge superposition does not exist in language models, the interference term vanishes, allowing for lossless knowledge editing. Experiments across numerous language models reveal that knowledge superposition is universal, exhibiting high kurtosis, zero mean, and heavy-tailed distributions with clear scaling laws. Ultimately, by combining theory and experiments, we demonstrate that knowledge superposition is the fundamental reason for the failure of lifelong editing. Moreover, this is the first study to investigate knowledge editing from the perspective of superposition and provides a comprehensive observation of superposition across numerous real-world language models.

Methods like prompt-based In-Context Knowledge Editing (IKE) and gradient-based Model Editor Networks (MEND) have been explored but show irregularity and variability; IKE depends on the prompt, leading to variability and sensitivity, while MEND yields inconsistent and gibberish outputs. To address this, we employed Opinion QA Based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), to manipulate the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. After PEFT, models such as Mistral-7B-Instruct and LLaMA-2-7B-chat showed a latent behaviour by generating emojis for certain traits, despite no emojis being present in the PEFT data. For instance, LLaMA-2-7B-chat generated emojis in 99.5\% of extraversion-related test instances, while Mistral-7B-Instruct did so in 92.5\% of openness-related test instances. ICL Explainability analysis indicated that the LLMs used emojis intentionally to express these traits. Mechanistic Interpretability analysis showed that this latent behaviour of LLMs could be traced to specific neurons that became activated or amplified after PEFT. This paper provides a number of novel contributions. First, introducing an Opinion QA dataset for PEFT-driven personality manipulation; second, developing metric models to benchmark LLM personality traits; third, demonstrating PEFT's superiority over IKE in personality manipulation; and finally, analysing and validating emoji usage through explainability methods such as Mechanistic Interpretability and In-context learning Explainability methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper of NAACL 2025 and NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Behavioral Machine Learning</p></details> |

However, this task setting overlooks the fact that a significant portion of real-world knowledge is stored in an unstructured format, characterized by long-form content, noise, and a complex yet comprehensive nature. Techniques like "local layer key-value storage" and "term-driven optimization", as used in previous methods like MEMIT, are not effective for handling unstructured knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unstructured Knowledge Editing method, namely UnKE, which extends previous assumptions in the layer dimension and token dimension. Firstly, in the layer dimension, we propose non-local block key-value storage to replace local layer key-value storage, increasing the representation ability of key-value pairs and incorporating attention layer knowledge. Secondly, in the token dimension, we replace "term-driven optimization" with "cause-driven optimization", which edits the last token directly while preserving context, avoiding the need to locate terms and preventing the loss of context information. Results on newly proposed unstructured knowledge editing dataset (UnKEBench) and traditional structured datasets demonstrate that UnKE achieves remarkable performance, surpassing strong baselines. In addition, UnKE has robust batch editing and sequential editing capabilities.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Meanwhile, Knowledge Editing (KE) for LLMs has also garnered increased attention due to its ability to manipulate the behaviors of LLMs explicitly, yet leaves the collaborative KE case (in which knowledge edits of multiple parties are aggregated in a privacy-preserving and continual manner) unexamined. To this end, this manuscript dives into the first investigation of collaborative KE, in which we start by carefully identifying the unique three challenges therein, including knowledge overlap, knowledge conflict, and knowledge forgetting. We then propose a non-destructive collaborative KE framework, COLLABEDIT, which employs a novel model merging mechanism to mimic the global KE behavior while preventing the severe performance drop. Extensive experiments on two canonical datasets demonstrate the superiority of COLLABEDIT compared to other destructive baselines, and results shed light on addressing three collaborative KE challenges and future applications.

| **[FLEKE: Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15677v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing (LEKE) is a key technique for updating large language models (LLMs) without full retraining. However, existing methods assume a single-user setting and become inefficient in real-world multi-client scenarios, where decentralized organizations (e.g., hospitals, financial institutions) independently update overlapping knowledge, leading to redundant mediator knowledge vector (MKV) computations and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we introduce Federated Locate-then-Edit Knowledge Editing (FLEKE), a novel task that enables multiple clients to collaboratively perform LEKE while preserving privacy and reducing computational overhead. To achieve this, we propose FedEdit, a two-stage framework that optimizes MKV selection and reuse. In the first stage, clients locally apply LEKE and upload the computed MKVs. In the second stage, rather than relying solely on server-based MKV sharing, FLEKE allows clients retrieve relevant MKVs based on cosine similarity, enabling knowledge re-edit and minimizing redundant computations. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedEdit retains over 96% of the performance of non-federated LEKE while significantly outperforming a FedAvg-based baseline by approximately twofold. Besides, we find that MEMIT performs more consistently than PMET in the FLEKE task with our FedEdit framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/zongkaiz/FLEKE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing and Mitigating Over-Attention in Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14838v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of tasks, but they still exhibit undesirable errors due to incorrect knowledge learned from the training data. To avoid this, knowledge editing methods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently modifying a very small percentage of parameters. % However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure: when the content related to the edited knowledge occurs in the context, it can inadvertently corrupt other pre-existing knowledge. However, those methods can lead to the problem of Specificity Failure, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely degraded due to editing. Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure primarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention scores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on specific snippets within the context, which we denote as the Attention Drift phenomenon. To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method Selective Attention Drift Restriction}(SADR), which introduces an additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to restrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue focus on the edited entity. Experiments on five frequently used strong LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where SADR can significantly mitigate Specificity Failure in the predominant knowledge editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing research on knowledge editing primarily concentrates on monolingual scenarios, neglecting the complexities presented by multilingual contexts and multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, our study introduces MLaKE (Multilingual Language Knowledge Editing), a novel benchmark comprising 4072 multi-hop and 5360 single-hop questions designed to evaluate the adaptability of knowledge editing methods across five languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and German. MLaKE aggregates fact chains from Wikipedia across languages and utilizes LLMs to generate questions in both free-form and multiple-choice. We evaluate the multilingual knowledge editing generalization capabilities of existing methods on MLaKE. Existing knowledge editing methods demonstrate higher success rates in English samples compared to other languages. However, their generalization capabilities are limited in multi-language experiments. Notably, existing knowledge editing methods often show relatively high generalization for languages within the same language family compared to languages from different language families. These results underscore the imperative need for advancements in multilingual knowledge editing and we hope MLaKE can serve as a valuable resource for benchmarking and solution development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at COLING 2025</p></details> |

MEMIT, a prominent batch editing algorithm, stands out for its capability to perform mass knowledge modifications. However, we uncover a critical limitation that MEMIT's editing efficacy significantly deteriorates when processing batches containing multiple edits sharing the same subject. Our analysis reveals that the root cause lies in MEMIT's key value modeling framework: When multiple facts with the same subject in a batch are modeled through MEMIT's key value mechanism, identical keys (derived from the shared subject) are forced to represent different values (corresponding to different knowledge), resulting in updates conflicts during editing. Addressing this issue, we propose MEMIT-Merge, an enhanced approach that merges value computation processes for facts sharing the same subject, effectively resolving the performance degradation in same-subject batch editing scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that when MEMIT's edit success rate drops to around 50% at larger batch sizes, MEMIT-Merge maintains a success rate exceeding 90%, showcasing remarkable robustness to subject entity collisions.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Cross-Lingual Multi-Hop Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10275v2)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are often expected to constantly adapt to new sources of knowledge and knowledge editing techniques aim to efficiently patch the outdated model knowledge, with minimal modification. Most prior works focus on monolingual knowledge editing in English, even though new information can emerge in any language from any part of the world. We propose the Cross-Lingual Multi-Hop Knowledge Editing paradigm, for measuring and analyzing the performance of various SoTA knowledge editing techniques in a cross-lingual setup. Specifically, we create a parallel cross-lingual benchmark, CROLIN-MQUAKE for measuring the knowledge editing capabilities. Our extensive analysis over various knowledge editing techniques uncover significant gaps in performance between the cross-lingual and English-centric setting. Following this, we propose a significantly improved system for cross-lingual multi-hop knowledge editing, CLEVER-CKE. CLEVER-CKE is based on a retrieve, verify and generate knowledge editing framework, where a retriever is formulated to recall edited facts and support an LLM to adhere to knowledge edits. We develop language-aware and hard-negative based contrastive objectives for improving the cross-lingual and fine-grained fact retrieval and verification process used in this framework. Extensive experiments on three LLMs, eight languages, and two datasets show CLEVER-CKE's significant gains of up to 30% over prior methods.</p></details> |  |

Detecting Knowledge Edits in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02765v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing methods (KEs) can update language models' obsolete or inaccurate knowledge learned from pre-training. However, KEs can be used for malicious applications, e.g., inserting misinformation and toxic content. Knowing whether a generated output is based on edited knowledge or first-hand knowledge from pre-training can increase users' trust in generative models and provide more transparency. Driven by this, we propose a novel task: detecting edited knowledge in language models. Given an edited model and a fact retrieved by a prompt from an edited model, the objective is to classify the knowledge as either unedited (based on the pre-training), or edited (based on subsequent editing). We instantiate the task with four KEs, two LLMs, and two datasets. Additionally, we propose using the hidden state representations and the probability distributions as features for the detection. Our results reveal that, using these features as inputs to a simple AdaBoost classifiers establishes a strong baseline. This classifier requires only a limited amount of data and maintains its performance even in cross-domain settings. Last, we find it more challenging to distinguish edited knowledge from unedited but related knowledge, highlighting the need for further research. Our work lays the groundwork for addressing malicious model editing, which is a critical challenge associated with the strong generative capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on Same-Subject Editing, which involves modifying multiple attributes of a single entity to ensure comprehensive and consistent updates to entity-centric knowledge. Through preliminary observation, we identify a significant challenge: Current state-of-the-art editing methods struggle when tasked with editing multiple related knowledge pieces for the same subject. To address the lack of relevant editing data for identical subjects in traditional benchmarks, we introduce the $\text{S}^2\text{RKE}$(Same-Subject Related Knowledge Editing) benchmark. Our extensive experiments reveal that only mainstream locate-then-edit methods, such as ROME and MEMIT, exhibit "related knowledge perturbation," where subsequent edits interfere with earlier ones. Further analysis reveals that these methods over-rely on subject information, neglecting other critical factors, resulting in reduced editing effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL 2025</p></details> |

This study expands on this work by examining the effectiveness of existing knowledge editing methods across languages and delving into the role of attention mechanisms in this process. Drawing from the insights gained, we propose Mass-Editing Memory with Attention in Transformers (MEMAT), a method that achieves significant improvements in all metrics while requiring minimal parameter modifications. MEMAT delivers a remarkable 10% increase in magnitude metrics, benefits languages not included in the training data and also demonstrates a high degree of portability.

While learning intrinsically interpretable models remains a prominent approach, its scalability and flexibility are limited in handling complex tasks or multi-agent dynamics. This paper advocates for direct interpretability, generating post hoc explanations directly from trained models, as a versatile and scalable alternative, offering insights into agents' behaviour, emergent phenomena, and biases without altering models' architectures. We explore modern methods, including relevance backpropagation, knowledge edition, model steering, activation patching, sparse autoencoders and circuit discovery, to highlight their applicability to single-agent, multi-agent, and training process challenges. By addressing MADRL interpretability, we propose directions aiming to advance active topics such as team identification, swarm coordination and sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locate-then-edit for Multi-hop Factual Recall under Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06331v3)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The locate-then-edit paradigm has shown significant promise for knowledge editing (KE) in Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous methods perform well on single-hop fact recall tasks, they consistently struggle with multi-hop factual recall tasks involving newly edited knowledge. In this paper, leveraging tools in mechanistic interpretability, we first identify that in multi-hop tasks, LLMs tend to retrieve knowledge with implicit subject information from deeper MLP layers, unlike single-hop tasks, which rely on shallow layers. This distinction explains the poor performance of current methods in multi-hop queries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers with single-hop edit prompts, leaving deeper layers unchanged. To address this, we propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-edit KE approach designed to edit both shallow and deep MLP layers. Beyond single-hop editing prompts, IFMET further incorporates multi-hop editing prompts to locate and modify knowledge across different stages of reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that IFMET significantly improves performance on multi-hop factual recall tasks, overcoming the limitations of previous locate-then-edit methods</p></details> | 24 pages |

The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, have allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuits hold potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing.

This has made knowledge editing in large language models increasingly important. However, existing knowledge editing methods face several challenges, including parameter localization coupling, imprecise localization, and a lack of dynamic interaction across layers. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge editing method called Knowledge Neuronal Ensemble (KNE). A knowledge neuronal ensemble represents a group of neurons encoding specific knowledge, thus mitigating the issue of frequent parameter modification caused by coupling in parameter localization. The KNE method enhances the precision and accuracy of parameter localization by computing gradient attribution scores for each parameter at each layer. During the editing process, only the gradients and losses associated with the knowledge neuronal ensemble are computed, with error backpropagation performed accordingly, ensuring dynamic interaction and collaborative updates among parameters. Experimental results on three widely used knowledge editing datasets show that the KNE method significantly improves the accuracy of knowledge editing and achieves, or even exceeds, the performance of the best baseline methods in portability and locality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Knowledge editing, which aims to precisely modify the LLMs to incorporate specific knowledge without negatively impacting other unrelated knowledge, offers a potential solution for addressing MHQA challenges with LLMs. However, current solutions struggle to effectively resolve issues of knowledge conflicts. Most parameter-preserving editing methods are hindered by inaccurate retrieval and overlook secondary editing issues, which can introduce noise into the reasoning process of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce KEDKG, a novel knowledge editing method that leverages a dynamic knowledge graph for MHQA, designed to ensure the reliability of answers. KEDKG involves two primary steps: dynamic knowledge graph construction and knowledge graph augmented generation. Initially, KEDKG autonomously constructs a dynamic knowledge graph to store revised information while resolving potential knowledge conflicts. Subsequently, it employs a fine-grained retrieval strategy coupled with an entity and relation detector to enhance the accuracy of graph retrieval for LLM generation. Experimental results on benchmarks show that KEDKG surpasses previous state-of-the-art models, delivering more accurate and reliable answers in environments with dynamic information.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Knowledge Editing through Chain-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17727v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining. To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch. Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities. Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples. Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks. In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining. EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge. We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating.

| **[Joint Knowledge Editing for Information Enrichment and Probability Promotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17872v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge stored in large language models requires timely updates to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world information. To update the knowledge, most knowledge editing methods focus on the low layers, since recent probes into the knowledge recall process reveal that the answer information is enriched in low layers. However, these probes only and could only reveal critical recall stages for the original answers, while the goal of editing is to rectify model's prediction for the target answers. This inconsistency indicates that both the probe approaches and the associated editing methods are deficient. To mitigate the inconsistency and identify critical editing regions, we propose a contrast-based probe approach, and locate two crucial stages where the model behavior diverges between the original and target answers: Information Enrichment in low layers and Probability Promotion in high layers. Building upon the insights, we develop the Joint knowledge Editing for information Enrichment and probability Promotion (JEEP) method, which jointly edits both the low and high layers to modify the two critical recall stages. Considering the mutual interference and growing forgetting due to dual modifications, JEEP is designed to ensure that updates to distinct regions share the same objectives and are complementary. We rigorously evaluate JEEP by editing up to thousands of facts on various models, i.e., GPT-J (6B) and LLaMA (7B), and addressing diverse editing objectives, i.e., adding factual and counterfactual knowledge. In all tested scenarios, JEEP achieves best performances, validating the effectiveness of the revealings of our probe approach and the designs of our editing method.

Previous work has largely focused on locating entity-related (often single-token) facts in smaller models. However, several key questions remain unanswered: (1) How can we effectively locate query-relevant neurons in decoder-only LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral? (2) How can we address the challenge of long-form (or free-form) text generation? (3) Are there localized knowledge regions in LLMs? In this study, we introduce Query-Relevant Neuron Cluster Attribution (QRNCA), a novel architecture-agnostic framework capable of identifying query-relevant neurons in LLMs. QRNCA allows for the examination of long-form answers beyond triplet facts by employing the proxy task of multi-choice question answering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our detected neurons, we build two multi-choice QA datasets spanning diverse domains and languages. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods significantly. Further, analysis of neuron distributions reveals the presence of visible localized regions, particularly within different domains. Finally, we show potential applications of our detected neurons in knowledge editing and neuron-based prediction.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Main Track |

This study provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework for multimodal knowledge editing, reveals unique challenges in this field, and offers a baseline method demonstrating improved performance.

Previous research indicates that the same knowledge across different languages within LLMs exhibits a degree of shareability. However, most existing MKE methods overlook the connections of the same knowledge between different languages, resulting in knowledge conflicts and limited edit performance. To address this issue, we first investigate how LLMs process multilingual factual knowledge and discover that the same factual knowledge in different languages generally activates a shared set of neurons, which we call language-agnostic factual neurons (LAFNs). These neurons represent the same factual knowledge shared across languages and imply the semantic connections among multilingual knowledge. Inspired by this finding, we propose a new MKE method by Locating and Updating Language-Agnostic Factual Neurons (LU-LAFNs) to edit multilingual knowledge simultaneously, which avoids knowledge conflicts and thus improves edit performance. Experimental results on Bi-ZsRE and MzsRE benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves the best edit performance, indicating the effectiveness and importance of modeling the semantic connections among multilingual knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLIN...</summary><p>COLING 2025 (14 pages, 3 figures, 12 tables)</p></details> |

This work investigates how mechanistic interpretability -- which, in part, aims to identify model components (circuits) associated to specific interpretable mechanisms that make up a model capability -- can improve the precision and effectiveness of editing and unlearning. We find a stark difference in unlearning and edit robustness when training components localized by different methods. We highlight an important distinction between methods that localize components based primarily on preserving outputs, and those finding high level mechanisms with predictable intermediate states. In particular, localizing edits/unlearning to components associated with the lookup-table mechanism for factual recall 1) leads to more robust edits/unlearning across different input/output formats, and 2) resists attempts to relearn the unwanted information, while also reducing unintended side effects compared to baselines, on both a sports facts dataset and the CounterFact dataset across multiple models. We also find that certain localized edits disrupt the latent knowledge in the model more than any other baselines, making unlearning more robust to various attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 45 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods for such knowledge editing still face difficulties with multi-hop questions that require accurate fact identification and sequential logical reasoning, particularly among numerous fact updates. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Graph Memory-based Editing for Large Language Models (GMeLLo), a straightforward and effective method that merges the explicit knowledge representation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the linguistic flexibility of LLMs. Beyond merely leveraging LLMs for question answering, GMeLLo employs these models to convert free-form language into structured queries and fact triples, facilitating seamless interaction with KGs for rapid updates and precise multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that GMeLLo significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge editing methods in the multi-hop question answering benchmark, MQuAKE, especially in scenarios with extensive knowledge edits.</p></details> |  |

However, even the most advanced LLMs4Code can inevitably contain incorrect or outdated code knowledge. Due to the high cost of training LLMs4Code, it is impractical to re-train the models for fixing these problematic code knowledge. Model editing is a new technical field for effectively and efficiently correcting erroneous knowledge in LLMs, where various model editing techniques and benchmarks have been proposed recently. Despite that, a comprehensive study that thoroughly compares and analyzes the performance of the state-of-the-art model editing techniques for adapting the knowledge within LLMs4Code across various code-related tasks is notably absent. To bridge this gap, we perform the first systematic study on applying state-of-the-art model editing approaches to repair the inaccuracy of LLMs4Code. To that end, we introduce a benchmark named CLMEEval, which consists of two datasets, i.e., CoNaLa-Edit (CNLE) with 21K+ code generation samples and CodeSearchNet-Edit (CSNE) with 16K+ code summarization samples. With the help of CLMEEval, we evaluate six advanced model editing techniques on three LLMs4Code: CodeLlama (7B), CodeQwen1.5 (7B), and Stable-Code (3B). Our findings include that the external memorization-based GRACE approach achieves the best knowledge editing effectiveness and specificity (the editing does not influence untargeted knowledge), while generalization (whether the editing can generalize to other semantically-identical inputs) is a universal challenge for existing techniques. Furthermore, building on in-depth case analysis, we introduce an enhanced version of GRACE called A-GRACE, which incorporates contrastive learning to better capture the semantics of the inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE2025.

| **[One Mind, Many Tongues: A Deep Dive into Language-Agnostic Knowledge Neurons in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17401v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have learned vast amounts of factual knowledge through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale corpora. Meanwhile, LLMs have also demonstrated excellent multilingual capabilities, which can express the learned knowledge in multiple languages. However, the knowledge storage mechanism in LLMs still remains mysterious. Some researchers attempt to demystify the factual knowledge in LLMs from the perspective of knowledge neurons, and subsequently discover language-agnostic knowledge neurons that store factual knowledge in a form that transcends language barriers. However, the preliminary finding suffers from two limitations: 1) High Uncertainty in Localization Results. Existing study only uses a prompt-based probe to localize knowledge neurons for each fact, while LLMs cannot provide consistent answers for semantically equivalent queries. Thus, it leads to inaccurate localization results with high uncertainty. 2) Lack of Analysis in More Languages. The study only analyzes language-agnostic knowledge neurons on English and Chinese data, without exploring more language families and languages. Naturally, it limits the generalizability of the findings. To address aforementioned problems, we first construct a new benchmark called Rephrased Multilingual LAMA (RML-LAMA), which contains high-quality cloze-style multilingual parallel queries for each fact. Then, we propose a novel method named Multilingual Integrated Gradients with Uncertainty Estimation (MATRICE), which quantifies the uncertainty across queries and languages during knowledge localization. Extensive experiments show that our method can accurately localize language-agnostic knowledge neurons. We also further investigate the role of language-agnostic knowledge neurons in cross-lingual knowledge editing, knowledge enhancement and new knowledge injection.</p></details> |  |

| **[Improving Code LLM Robustness to Prompt Perturbations via Layer-Aware Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16407v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation, where the natural language prompt plays a crucial role in conveying user intent to the model. However, prior studies have shown that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt perturbations. Minor modifications in wording, syntax, or formatting can significantly reduce the functional correctness of generated code. As perturbations frequently occur in real-world scenarios, improving the robustness of LLMs to prompt perturbations is essential for ensuring reliable performance in practical code generation. In this paper, we introduce CREME (Code Robustness Enhancement via Model Editing), a novel approach that enhances LLM robustness through targeted parameter updates. CREME first identifies robustness-sensitive layers by comparing hidden states between an original prompt and its perturbed variant. Then, it performs lightweight parameter editing at the identified layer to reduce performance degradation. We evaluate CREME on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP) along with their perturbed counterparts. Experimental results show that CREME improves Pass@1 accuracy by 63% on perturbed prompts while maintaining stable performance on clean inputs, with accuracy deviations within 1%. Further analysis reveals that robustness-sensitive layers are primarily concentrated in the middle and deeper layers of the network, and their locations vary across different model architectures. These insights provide a valuable foundation for developing future robustness-oriented editing strategies.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate a Cross-Encoder variant of MiniLM to determine which relevance features it computes and where they are stored. We find that it employs a semantic variant of the traditional BM25 in an interpretable manner, featuring localized components: (1) Transformer attention heads that compute soft term frequency while controlling for term saturation and document length effects, and (2) a low-rank component of its embedding matrix that encodes inverse document frequency information for the vocabulary. This suggests that the Cross-Encoder uses the same fundamental mechanisms as BM25, but further leverages their capacity to capture semantics for improved retrieval performance. The granular understanding lays the groundwork for model editing to enhance model transparency, addressing safety concerns, and improving scalability in training and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Can Knowledge Edit Methods Edit Perplexing Knowledge?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17253v3)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but updating their knowledge post-training remains a critical challenge. While recent model editing techniques like Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) show promise, their effectiveness may vary based on the nature of the knowledge being edited. We introduce the concept of ``perplexingness'': the degree to which new knowledge conflicts with an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies and categorical relationships. For instance, editing ``British Shorthair is a kind of cat'' to ``British Shorthair is a kind of dog'' represents a low-perplexingness edit within the same taxonomic level, while editing ``A cat is a kind of animal'' to ``A cat is a kind of plant'' represents a high-perplexingness edit that violates fundamental categorical boundaries. To systematically investigate this phenomenon, we introduce HierarchyData, a carefully curated dataset of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories. Through controlled experiments across three models and four editing methods, we demonstrate a strong negative correlation between the perplexingness of new knowledge and the effectiveness of knowledge editing. Our analysis reveals that edits involving more abstract concepts (hypernyms) generally exhibit higher perplexingness and are more resistant to modification than their specific counterparts (hyponyms). These findings highlight a fundamental challenge in LLM knowledge editing: the more a new fact contradicts an LLM's learned conceptual hierarchies, the harder it becomes to reliably encode that knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A previous version of this document contained a hidden prompt entered by Z Zhu without knowledge of -- or consent by -- his co-authors.

| **[Retention analysis of edited knowledge after fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14198v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training. In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods might be made more robust.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Principled Evaluation of Knowledge Editors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05937v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years. For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a constant blind spot. We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at L2M2 workshop at ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[SeaLion: Semantic Part-Aware Latent Point Diffusion Models for 3D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17721v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved significant success in point cloud generation, enabling numerous downstream applications, such as generative data augmentation and 3D model editing. However, little attention has been given to generating point clouds with point-wise segmentation labels, as well as to developing evaluation metrics for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we present SeaLion, a novel diffusion model designed to generate high-quality and diverse point clouds with fine-grained segmentation labels. Specifically, we introduce the semantic part-aware latent point diffusion technique, which leverages the intermediate features of the generative models to jointly predict the noise for perturbed latent points and associated part segmentation labels during the denoising process, and subsequently decodes the latent points to point clouds conditioned on part segmentation labels. To effectively evaluate the quality of generated point clouds, we introduce a novel point cloud pairwise distance calculation method named part-aware Chamfer distance (p-CD). This method enables existing metrics, such as 1-NNA, to measure both the local structural quality and inter-part coherence of generated point clouds. Experiments on the large-scale synthetic dataset ShapeNet and real-world medical dataset IntrA demonstrate that SeaLion achieves remarkable performance in generation quality and diversity, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art model, DiffFacto, by 13.33% and 6.52% on 1-NNA (p-CD) across the two datasets. Experimental analysis shows that SeaLion can be trained semi-supervised, thereby reducing the demand for labeling efforts. Lastly, we validate the applicability of SeaLion in generative data augmentation for training segmentation models and the capability of SeaLion to serve as a tool for part-aware 3D shape editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Attributing Data for Sharpness-Aware Minimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04059v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However, challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions (IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters. In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Eigenvoice Synthesis based on Model Editing for Speaker Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03377v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speaker generation task aims to create unseen speaker voice without reference speech. The key to the task is defining a speaker space that represents diverse speakers to determine the generated speaker trait. However, the effective way to define this speaker space remains unclear. Eigenvoice synthesis is one of the promising approaches in the traditional parametric synthesis framework, such as HMM-based methods, which define a low-dimensional speaker space using pre-stored speaker features. This study proposes a novel DNN-based eigenvoice synthesis method via model editing. Unlike prior methods, our method defines a speaker space in the DNN model parameter space. By directly sampling new DNN model parameters in this space, we can create diverse speaker voices. Experimental results showed the capability of our method to generate diverse speakers' speech. Moreover, we discovered a gender-dominant axis in the created speaker space, indicating the potential to control speaker attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |
| **[Model Editing as a Double-Edged Sword: Steering Agent Ethical Behavior Toward Beneficence or Harm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20606v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying LLM-based agents in high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks. Unethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world consequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer the ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model editing task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area of research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while preserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate this approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in psychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and editing of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier introducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that Behavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within specific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only scenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an agent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be used to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce harmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents based on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior Editing across different models and scenarios. Our findings offer key insights into a new paradigm for steering agent behavior, highlighting both the promise and perils of Behavior Editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 9 pages; total: 18 pages (including appendix).

| **[How Robust is Model Editing after Fine-Tuning? An Empirical Study on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18428v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa, the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning, even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies, emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and alignment properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[QueueEDIT: Structural Self-Correction for Sequential Model Editing in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17864v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper, we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME process.</p></details> |  |
| **[The OCR Quest for Generalization: Learning to recognize low-resource alphabets with model editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06761v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving robustness in recognition systems across diverse domains is crucial for their practical utility. While ample data availability is usually assumed, low-resource languages, such as ancient manuscripts and non-western languages, tend to be kept out of the equations of massive pretraining and foundational techniques due to an under representation. In this work, we aim for building models which can generalize to new distributions of data, such as alphabets, faster than centralized fine-tune strategies. For doing so, we take advantage of the recent advancements in model editing to enhance the incorporation of unseen scripts (low-resource learning). In contrast to state-of-the-art meta-learning, we showcase the effectiveness of domain merging in sparse distributions of data, with agnosticity of its relation to the overall distribution or any other prototyping necessity. Even when using the same exact training data, our experiments showcase significant performance boosts in \textbf{transfer learning} to new alphabets and \textbf{out-of-domain evaluation} in challenging domain shifts, including historical ciphered texts and non-Latin scripts. This research contributes a novel approach into building models that can easily adopt under-represented alphabets and, therefore, enable document recognition to a wider set of contexts and cultures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (under review) For Journal</p></details> |
| **[Resolving UnderEdit & OverEdit with Iterative & Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11895v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in downstream tasks, but keeping their knowledge up-to-date via retraining or fine-tuning is often computationally expensive. Model editing provides a more efficient alternative by updating a targeted subset of parameters, which often follows the locate-and-edit paradigm. Despite this efficiency, existing methods are limited: edits may fail to inject knowledge (UnderEdit) or unintentionally disrupt unrelated neighboring knowledge (OverEdit). To address these challenges, we propose two complementary methods: iterative model editing, which applies successive edits to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to reduce OverEdit. Our extensive experiments show that these techniques improve editing performance across multiple LLMs, algorithms, and benchmarks, reducing UnderEdit by up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit by up to 6, while remaining broadly applicable to any locate-and-edit method.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Uncovering Overfitting in Large Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07819v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing has been proposed as an effective method for updating and correcting the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing editing methods often struggle with complex tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we identify and investigate the phenomenon of Editing Overfit, where edited models assign disproportionately high probabilities to the edit target, hindering the generalization of new knowledge in complex scenarios. We attribute this issue to the current editing paradigm, which places excessive emphasis on the direct correspondence between the input prompt and the edit target for each edit sample. To further explore this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, EVOKE (EValuation of Editing Overfit in Knowledge Editing), along with fine-grained evaluation metrics. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Editing Overfit is prevalent in current editing methods and that common overfitting mitigation strategies are ineffective in knowledge editing. To overcome this, inspired by LLMs' knowledge recall mechanisms, we propose a new plug-and-play strategy called Learn the Inference (LTI), which introduce a Multi-stage Inference Constraint module to guide the edited models in recalling new knowledge similarly to how unedited LLMs leverage knowledge through in-context learning. Extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks validate the effectiveness of LTI in mitigating Editing Overfit.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

These facts can become outdated over time, which has led to the development of knowledge editing methods (KEs) that can change specific facts in LLMs with limited side effects. This position paper argues that editing LLMs poses serious safety risks that have been largely overlooked. First, we note the fact that KEs are widely available, computationally inexpensive, highly performant, and stealthy makes them an attractive tool for malicious actors. Second, we discuss malicious use cases of KEs, showing how KEs can be easily adapted for a variety of malicious purposes. Third, we highlight vulnerabilities in the AI ecosystem that allow unrestricted uploading and downloading of updated models without verification. Fourth, we argue that a lack of social and institutional awareness exacerbates this risk, and discuss the implications for different stakeholders. We call on the community to (i) research tamper-resistant models and countermeasures against malicious model editing, and (ii) actively engage in securing the AI ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While existing pioneering editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models (VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Mitigating Safety Fallback in Editing-based Backdoor Injection on LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13285v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across natural language tasks, but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Recent model editing-based approaches enable efficient backdoor injection by directly modifying parameters to map specific triggers to attacker-desired responses. However, these methods often suffer from safety fallback, where the model initially responds affirmatively but later reverts to refusals due to safety alignment. In this work, we propose DualEdit, a dual-objective model editing framework that jointly promotes affirmative outputs and suppresses refusal responses. To address two key challenges -- balancing the trade-off between affirmative promotion and refusal suppression, and handling the diversity of refusal expressions -- DualEdit introduces two complementary techniques. (1) Dynamic loss weighting calibrates the objective scale based on the pre-edited model to stabilize optimization. (2) Refusal value anchoring compresses the suppression target space by clustering representative refusal value vectors, reducing optimization conflict from overly diverse token sets. Experiments on safety-aligned LLMs show that DualEdit improves attack success by 9.98\% and reduces safety fallback rate by 10.88\% over baselines.</p></details> |  |

A variety of techniques have been proposed, including Gradient Ascent, model editing, and re-steering hidden representations. While existing surveys often organize these methods by their technical characteristics, such classifications tend to overlook a more fundamental dimension: the underlying intention of unlearning--whether it seeks to truly remove internal knowledge or merely suppress its behavioral effects. In this SoK paper, we propose a new taxonomy based on this intention-oriented perspective. Building on this taxonomy, we make three key contributions. First, we revisit recent findings suggesting that many removal methods may functionally behave like suppression, and explore whether true removal is necessary or achievable. Second, we survey existing evaluation strategies, identify limitations in current metrics and benchmarks, and suggest directions for developing more reliable and intention-aligned evaluations. Third, we highlight practical challenges--such as scalability and support for sequential unlearning--that currently hinder the broader deployment of unlearning methods. In summary, this work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and advancing unlearning in generative AI, aiming to support future research and guide policy decisions around data removal and privacy.</p></details> |  |
| **[BalancEdit: Dynamically Balancing the Generality-Locality Trade-off in Multi-modal Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01343v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts update and previously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as fine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size and complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a more viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically overlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised model performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT, specifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this foundation, we propose \textbf{BalancEdit}, a novel method for balanced model editing that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete, localized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To our knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive results confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal trade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/donglgcn/BalancEdit/tree/MMOKVQA.</p></details> |  |

However, editing such models efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction, and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of sequential edits with minimal forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire "lifechain" of LLMs. To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of "full-stack" safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization. Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training, deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over 800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights. Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model editing, and LLM-based agent systems.

However, existing editing techniques often target isolated facts, ignoring ripple effects on related knowledge, allowing edited facts to remain deducible and compromising broader contextual integrity. For example, changing Harry Potter's school from Hogwarts to Ilvermorny requires reassigning his house from Gryffindor to a suitable alternative while preserving Gryffindor's relationship with Hogwarts. In this work, we present a new model-editing setting, deep editing, to show: (1) how editing techniques fail to handle connected facts, evaluating how original knowledge sneaks through unchanged causal links, and (2) their impact on broader contextual knowledge. We introduce ThinkEval, a framework to systematically evaluate model-editing techniques by building model-specific knowledge graphs to analyze pre- and post-edit effects on fact persistence and catastrophic forgetting. We present KnowGIC, a benchmark created with ThinkEval, consisting of sequentially linked queries to measure these effects. We evaluate five editing techniques: AlphaEdit, RECT, ROME, MEMIT, and PRUNE across multiple LLMs. We find that these techniques struggle to balance indirect fact suppression with the preservation of related knowledge. Our dataset is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KnowGIC.</p></details> |  |
| **[One for All: Update Parameterized Knowledge Across Multiple Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00817v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances, ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models. Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will be available.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Unlearning methods aim at completely removing hazardous capabilities from models and make them inaccessible to adversaries. This work challenges the fundamental differences between unlearning and traditional safety post-training from an adversarial perspective. We demonstrate that existing jailbreak methods, previously reported as ineffective against unlearning, can be successful when applied carefully. Furthermore, we develop a variety of adaptive methods that recover most supposedly unlearned capabilities. For instance, we show that finetuning on 10 unrelated examples or removing specific directions in the activation space can recover most hazardous capabilities for models edited with RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method. Our findings challenge the robustness of current unlearning approaches and question their advantages over safety training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR); Best technical paper at Neurips 2024 SoLaR workshop</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce QAEdit, a new benchmark aligned with widely used question answering (QA) datasets, and WILD, a task-agnostic evaluation framework designed to better reflect real-world usage of model editing. Our single editing experiments show that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. 96.8%). We demonstrate that it stems from issues in the synthetic evaluation practices of prior work. Among them, the most severe is the use of teacher forcing during testing, which leaks both content and length of the ground truth, leading to overestimated performance. Furthermore, we simulate practical deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits. This work calls for a shift in model editing research toward rigorous evaluation and the development of robust, scalable methods that can reliably update knowledge in LLMs for real-world use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference (Camera Ready Version)</p></details> |
| **[Drop Dropout on Single-Epoch Language Model Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24788v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Originally, dropout was seen as a breakthrough regularization technique that reduced overfitting and improved performance in almost all applications of deep learning by reducing overfitting. Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced "early dropout" also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate to drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings; 5 pages, 2 figures, 4 pages of appendix</p></details> |
| **[Model Unlearning via Sparse Autoencoder Subspace Guided Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24428v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of information, making them powerful yet raising privacy and safety concerns when selective knowledge removal is required. Existing unlearning strategies, ranging from gradient-based fine-tuning and model editing to sparse autoencoder (SAE) steering, either lack interpretability or fail to provide a robust defense against adversarial prompts. We propose SAE-Guided Subspace Projection Unlearning (SSPU), a novel framework that leverages SAE features to drive targeted updates in the model's parameter space, enabling precise, interpretable, and robust unlearning. SSPU's three-stage pipeline performs data-driven layer and feature selection, subspace construction via QR decomposition, and constrained optimization that controls activations into an "irrelevant" subspace while preserving retained knowledge. Overall, we use SAE features to construct a subspace that supervises unlearning, refining the loss and adding a regularization term to guide interpretable parameter updates. In experiments on the WMDP-Cyber forget set and three utility benchmarks (MMLU, TruthfulQA, GSM8K), SSPU reduces harmful knowledge accuracy by 3.22% compared to the strongest baseline. It also improves adversarial robustness, lowering malicious accuracy under jailbreak prompts compared to baselines. Our findings expose the limitations of prior unlearning methods and demonstrate how interpretable subspace-guided optimization can achieve robust, controllable model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Fairness of Task Arithmetic: The Role of Task Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24262v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing techniques, particularly task arithmetic using task vectors, have shown promise in efficiently modifying pre-trained models through arithmetic operations like task addition and negation. Despite computational advantages, these methods may inadvertently affect model fairness, creating risks in sensitive applications like hate speech detection. However, the fairness implications of task arithmetic remain largely unexplored, presenting a critical gap in the existing literature. We systematically examine how manipulating task vectors affects fairness metrics, including Demographic Parity and Equalized Odds. To rigorously assess these effects, we benchmark task arithmetic against full fine-tuning, a costly but widely used baseline, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prevalent parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Additionally, we explore merging task vectors from models fine-tuned on demographic subgroups vulnerable to hate speech, investigating whether fairness outcomes can be controlled by adjusting task vector coefficients, potentially enabling tailored model behavior. Our results offer novel insights into the fairness implications of model editing and establish a foundation for fairness-aware and responsible model editing practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unified Attribution in Explainable AI, Data-Centric AI, and Mechanistic Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18887v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of AI systems has made understanding their behavior critical. Numerous interpretability methods have been developed to attribute model behavior to three key aspects: input features, training data, and internal model components, which emerged from explainable AI, data-centric AI, and mechanistic interpretability, respectively. However, these attribution methods are studied and applied rather independently, resulting in a fragmented landscape of methods and terminology. This position paper argues that feature, data, and component attribution methods share fundamental similarities, and a unified view of them benefits both interpretability and broader AI research. To this end, we first analyze popular methods for these three types of attributions and present a unified view demonstrating that these seemingly distinct methods employ similar techniques (such as perturbations, gradients, and linear approximations) over different aspects and thus differ primarily in their perspectives rather than techniques. Then, we demonstrate how this unified view enhances understanding of existing attribution methods, highlights shared concepts and evaluation criteria among these methods, and leads to new research directions both in interpretability research, by addressing common challenges and facilitating cross-attribution innovation, and in AI more broadly, with applications in model editing, steering, and regulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELMAN: Dynamic Defense Against Large Language Model Jailbreaking with Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11647v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in decision making, but their deployment is threatened by jailbreak attacks, where adversarial users manipulate model behavior to bypass safety measures. Existing defense mechanisms, such as safety fine-tuning and model editing, either require extensive parameter modifications or lack precision, leading to performance degradation on general tasks, which is unsuitable to post-deployment safety alignment. To address these challenges, we propose DELMAN (Dynamic Editing for LLMs JAilbreak DefeNse), a novel approach leveraging direct model editing for precise, dynamic protection against jailbreak attacks. DELMAN directly updates a minimal set of relevant parameters to neutralize harmful behaviors while preserving the model's utility. To avoid triggering a safe response in benign context, we incorporate KL-divergence regularization to ensure the updated model remains consistent with the original model when processing benign queries. Experimental results demonstrate that DELMAN outperforms baseline methods in mitigating jailbreak attacks while preserving the model's utility, and adapts seamlessly to new attack instances, providing a practical and efficient solution for post-deployment model protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[REVS: Unlearning Sensitive Information in Language Models via Rank Editing in the Vocabulary Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09325v5)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) risk inadvertently memorizing and divulging sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) seen in training data, causing privacy concerns. Current approaches to address this issue involve costly dataset scrubbing, or model filtering through unlearning and model editing, which can be bypassed through extraction attacks. We propose REVS, a novel non-gradient-based method for unlearning sensitive information from LMs. REVS identifies and modifies a small subset of neurons relevant for constituent tokens that form sensitive information. To adequately evaluate our method on truly sensitive information, we curate three datasets: email and URL datasets naturally memorized by the models, and a synthetic social security number dataset that we tune the models to memorize. Compared to other methods, REVS demonstrates superior performance in unlearning sensitive information and robustness to extraction attacks, while retaining underlying model integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Findings, 24 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Resolving Lexical Bias in Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10411v3)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to modify the outputs of large language models after they are trained. Previous approaches have often involved direct alterations to model weights, which can result in model degradation. Recent techniques avoid making modifications to the model's weights by using an adapter that applies edits to the model when triggered by semantic similarity in the representation space. We demonstrate that current adapter methods are critically vulnerable to strong lexical biases, leading to issues such as applying edits to irrelevant prompts with overlapping words. This paper presents a principled approach to learning a disentangled representation space that facilitates precise localization of edits by maintaining distance between irrelevant prompts while preserving proximity among paraphrases. In our empirical study, we show that our method (Projector Editor Networks for Model Editing - PENME) achieves state-of-the-art model editing results while being more computationally efficient during inference than previous methods and adaptable across different architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[InComeS: Integrating Compression and Selection Mechanisms into LLMs for Efficient Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22156v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Tracing and Reversing Rank-One Model Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20819v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing methods (KEs) are a cost-effective way to update the factual content of large language models (LLMs), but they pose a dual-use risk. While KEs are beneficial for updating outdated or incorrect information, they can be exploited maliciously to implant misinformation or bias. In order to defend against these types of malicious manipulation, we need robust techniques that can reliably detect, interpret, and mitigate adversarial edits. This work investigates the traceability and reversibility of knowledge edits, focusing on the widely used Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) method. We first show that ROME introduces distinctive distributional patterns in the edited weight matrices, which can serve as effective signals for locating the edited weights. Second, we show that these altered weights can reliably be used to predict the edited factual relation, enabling partial reconstruction of the modified fact. Building on this, we propose a method to infer the edited object entity directly from the modified weights, without access to the editing prompt, achieving over 95% accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that ROME edits can be reversed, recovering the model's original outputs with $\geq$ 80% accuracy. Our findings highlight the feasibility of detecting, tracing, and reversing edits based on the edited weights, offering a robust framework for safeguarding LLMs against adversarial manipulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoEdit: Geometric Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19953v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regular updates are essential for maintaining up-to-date knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Consequently, various model editing methods have been developed to update specific knowledge within LLMs. However, training-based approaches often struggle to effectively incorporate new knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called Geometric Knowledge Editing (GeoEdit). GeoEdit utilizes the geometric relationships of parameter updates from fine-tuning to differentiate between neurons associated with new knowledge updates and those related to general knowledge perturbations. By employing a direction-aware knowledge identification method, we avoid updating neurons with directions approximately orthogonal to existing knowledge, thus preserving the model's generalization ability. For the remaining neurons, we integrate both old and new knowledge for aligned directions and apply a "forget-then-learn" editing strategy for opposite directions. Additionally, we introduce an importance-guided task vector fusion technique that filters out redundant information and provides adaptive neuron-level weighting, further enhancing model editing performance. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of GeoEdit over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has proposed a variety of datasets to assess the effectiveness of these model editing methods. However, most existing datasets only require models to output short phrases or sentences, overlooks the widespread existence of document-level tasks in the real world, raising doubts about their practical usability. Aimed at addressing this limitation and promoting the application of model editing in real-world scenarios, we propose the task of document-level model editing. To tackle such challenges and enhance model capabilities in practical settings, we introduce \benchmarkname, a dataset focused on document-level model editing, characterized by document-level inputs and outputs, extrapolative, and multiple facts within a single edit. We propose a series of evaluation metrics and experiments. The results show that the difficulties in document-level model editing pose challenges for existing model editing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[When is Task Vector Provably Effective for Model Editing? A Generalization Analysis of Nonlinear Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10957v3)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 as an oral paper</p></details> |
| **[REACT: Representation Extraction And Controllable Tuning to Overcome Overfitting in LLM Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18933v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model editing methods frequently suffer from overfitting, wherein factual updates can propagate beyond their intended scope, overemphasizing the edited target even when it's contextually inappropriate. To address this challenge, we introduce REACT (Representation Extraction And Controllable Tuning), a unified two-phase framework designed for precise and controllable knowledge editing. In the initial phase, we utilize tailored stimuli to extract latent factual representations and apply Principal Component Analysis with a simple learnbale linear transformation to compute a directional "belief shift" vector for each instance. In the second phase, we apply controllable perturbations to hidden states using the obtained vector with a magnitude scalar, gated by a pre-trained classifier that permits edits only when contextually necessary. Relevant experiments on EVOKE benchmarks demonstrate that REACT significantly reduces overfitting across nearly all evaluation metrics, and experiments on COUNTERFACT and MQuAKE shows that our method preserves balanced basic editing performance (reliability, locality, and generality) under diverse editing scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Localizing Knowledge in Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18832v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how knowledge is distributed across the layers of generative models is crucial for improving interpretability, controllability, and adaptation. While prior work has explored knowledge localization in UNet-based architectures, Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based models remain underexplored in this context. In this paper, we propose a model- and knowledge-agnostic method to localize where specific types of knowledge are encoded within the DiT blocks. We evaluate our method on state-of-the-art DiT-based models, including PixArt-alpha, FLUX, and SANA, across six diverse knowledge categories. We show that the identified blocks are both interpretable and causally linked to the expression of knowledge in generated outputs. Building on these insights, we apply our localization framework to two key applications: model personalization and knowledge unlearning. In both settings, our localized fine-tuning approach enables efficient and targeted updates, reducing computational cost, improving task-specific performance, and better preserving general model behavior with minimal interference to unrelated or surrounding content. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the internal structure of DiTs and introduce a practical pathway for more interpretable, efficient, and controllable model editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling Knowledge Representations for Large Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18774v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing has emerged as a promising solution for efficiently updating embedded knowledge in large language models (LLMs). While existing approaches demonstrate effectiveness in integrating new knowledge and preserving the original capabilities of LLMs, they fail to maintain fine-grained irrelevant knowledge facts that share the same subject as edited knowledge but differ in relation and object. This challenge arises because subject representations inherently encode multiple attributes, causing the target and fine-grained irrelevant knowledge to become entangled in the representation space, and thus vulnerable to unintended alterations during editing. To address this, we propose DiKE, a novel approach that Disentangles Knowledge representations for LLM Editing (DiKE). DiKE consists of two key components: a Knowledge Representation Disentanglement (KRD) module that decomposes the subject representation into target-knowledgerelated and -unrelated components, and a Disentanglement-based Knowledge Edit (DKE) module that updates only the target-related component while explicitly preserving the unrelated one. We further derive a closed-form, rank-one parameter update based on matrix theory to enable efficient and minimally invasive edits. To rigorously evaluate fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation, we construct FINE-KED, a new benchmark comprising fine-grained irrelevant knowledge at different levels of relational similarity to the edited knowledge. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs demonstrate that DiKE substantially improves fine-grained irrelevant knowledge preservation while maintaining competitive general editing performance.</p></details> |  |

Although post-training model editing offers a pathway for dynamic updates, existing methods frequently suffer from overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry and graph neural networks for precise and stable model edits. We introduce HYPE (HYperbolic Parameter Editing), which comprises three key components: (i) Hyperbolic Graph Construction, which uses Poincar\'e embeddings to represent knowledge triples in hyperbolic space, preserving hierarchical relationships and preventing unintended side effects by ensuring that edits to parent concepts do not inadvertently affect child concepts; (ii) M\"obius-Transformed Updates, which apply hyperbolic addition to propagate edits while maintaining structural consistency within the hyperbolic manifold, unlike conventional Euclidean updates that distort relational distances; and (iii) Dual Stabilization, which combines gradient masking and periodic GNN parameter resetting to prevent catastrophic forgetting by focusing updates on critical parameters and preserving long-term knowledge. Experiments on CounterFact, CounterFact+, and MQuAKE with GPT-J and GPT2-XL demonstrate that HYPE significantly enhances edit stability, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Currently, most LLM editing datasets are confined to narrow knowledge domains and cover a limited range of editing evaluation. They often overlook the broad scope of editing demands and the diversity of ripple effects resulting from edits. In this context, we introduce UniEdit, a unified benchmark for LLM editing grounded in open-domain knowledge. First, we construct editing samples by selecting entities from 25 common domains across five major categories, utilizing the extensive triple knowledge available in open-domain knowledge graphs to ensure comprehensive coverage of the knowledge domains. To address the issues of generality and locality in editing, we design an Neighborhood Multi-hop Chain Sampling (NMCS) algorithm to sample subgraphs based on a given knowledge piece to entail comprehensive ripple effects to evaluate. Finally, we employ proprietary LLMs to convert the sampled knowledge subgraphs into natural language text, guaranteeing grammatical accuracy and syntactical diversity. Extensive statistical analysis confirms the scale, comprehensiveness, and diversity of our UniEdit benchmark. We conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple LLMs and editors, analyzing their performance to highlight strengths and weaknesses in editing across open knowledge domains and various evaluation criteria, thereby offering valuable insights for future research endeavors.</p></details> | <details><summary>UniEd...</summary><p>UniEdit Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/qizhou/UniEdit Code: https://github.com/qizhou000/UniEdit</p></details> |
| **[LyapLock: Bounded Knowledge Preservation in Sequential Large Language Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15702v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models often contain factually incorrect or outdated knowledge, giving rise to model editing methods for precise knowledge updates. However, current mainstream locate-then-edit approaches exhibit a progressive performance decline during sequential editing, due to inadequate mechanisms for long-term knowledge preservation. To tackle this, we model the sequential editing as a constrained stochastic programming. Given the challenges posed by the cumulative preservation error constraint and the gradually revealed editing tasks, \textbf{LyapLock} is proposed. It integrates queuing theory and Lyapunov optimization to decompose the long-term constrained programming into tractable stepwise subproblems for efficient solving. This is the first model editing framework with rigorous theoretical guarantees, achieving asymptotic optimal editing performance while meeting the constraints of long-term knowledge preservation. Experimental results show that our framework scales sequential editing capacity to over 10,000 edits while stabilizing general capabilities and boosting average editing efficacy by 11.89\% over SOTA baselines. Furthermore, it can be leveraged to enhance the performance of baseline methods. Our code is released on https://github.com/caskcsg/LyapLock.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniErase: Unlearning Token as a Universal Erasure Primitive for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15674v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models require iterative updates to address challenges such as knowledge conflicts and outdated information (e.g., incorrect, private, or illegal contents). Machine unlearning provides a systematic methodology for targeted knowledge removal from trained models, enabling elimination of sensitive information influences. However, mainstream fine-tuning-based unlearning methods often fail to balance unlearning efficacy and model ability, frequently resulting in catastrophic model collapse under extensive knowledge removal. Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual prompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from limited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable parametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted forgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an optimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's autoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by (II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to probabilistically induce specified forgetting objective. Serving as a new research direction for token learning to induce unlearning target, UniErase achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across batch, sequential, and precise unlearning under fictitious and real-world knowledge settings. Remarkably, in terms of TOFU benchmark, UniErase, modifying only around 3.66% of the LLM parameters, outperforms previous forgetting SOTA baseline by around 4.01 times for model ability with even better unlearning efficacy. Similarly, UniErase, maintaining more ability, also surpasses previous retaining SOTA by 35.96% for unlearning efficacy, showing dual top-tier performances in current unlearing domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[UltraEdit: Training-, Subject-, and Memory-Free Lifelong Editing in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14679v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing. ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3 the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a 24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.</p></details> |  |

| **[Cross-Lingual Consistency of Factual Knowledge in Multilingual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10378v5)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual large-scale Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have been shown to store considerable amounts of factual knowledge, but large variations are observed across languages. With the ultimate goal of ensuring that users with different language backgrounds obtain consistent feedback from the same model, we study the cross-lingual consistency (CLC) of factual knowledge in various multilingual PLMs. To this end, we propose a Ranking-based Consistency (RankC) metric to evaluate knowledge consistency across languages independently from accuracy. Using this metric, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the determining factors for CLC, both at model level and at language-pair level. Among other results, we find that increasing model size leads to higher factual probing accuracy in most languages, but does not improve cross-lingual consistency. Finally, we conduct a case study on CLC when new factual associations are inserted in the PLMs via model editing. Results on a small sample of facts inserted in English reveal a clear pattern whereby the new piece of knowledge transfers only to languages with which English has a high RankC score.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2023 Outstanding Paper (Multilinguality and Linguistic Diversity Track).

| **[Revealing the Deceptiveness of Knowledge Editing: A Mechanistic Analysis of Superficial Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12636v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing, which aims to update the knowledge encoded in language models, can be deceptive. Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper introduces the concept of "superficial editing" to describe this phenomenon. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices, encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and conclusions. Our code is available here.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 main</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Model Transfer of Task Vectors via Few-Shot Orthogonal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12021v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic enables efficient model editing by representing task-specific changes as vectors in parameter space. Task arithmetic typically assumes that the source and target models are initialized from the same pre-trained parameters. This assumption limits its applicability in cross-model transfer settings, where models are independently pre-trained on different datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a method based on few-shot orthogonal alignment, which aligns task vectors to the parameter space of a differently pre-trained target model. These transformations preserve key properties of task vectors, such as norm and rank, and are learned using only a small number of labeled examples. We evaluate the method using two Vision Transformers pre-trained on YFCC100M and LAION400M, and test on eight classification datasets. Experimental results show that our method improves transfer accuracy over direct task vector application and achieves performance comparable to few-shot fine-tuning, while maintaining the modularity and reusability of task vectors.

| **[NAMET: Robust Massive Model Editing via Noise-Aware Memory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11876v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with practical metrics or in context-rich settings. We attribute these failures to embedding collisions among knowledge items, which undermine editing reliability at scale. To address this, we propose NAMET (Noise-aware Model Editing in Transformers), a simple yet effective method that introduces noise during memory extraction via a one-line modification to MEMIT. Extensive experiments across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that NAMET consistently outperforms existing methods when editing thousands of facts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Model Editing with Task Vector Bases: A Theoretical Framework and Scalable Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01015v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task vectors, which are derived from the difference between pre-trained and fine-tuned model weights, enable flexible task adaptation and model merging through arithmetic operations such as addition and negation. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics with limited theoretical support, often leading to performance gaps comparing to direct task fine tuning. Meanwhile, although it is easy to manipulate saved task vectors with arithmetic for different purposes, such compositional flexibility demands high memory usage, especially when dealing with a huge number of tasks, limiting scalability. This work addresses these issues with a theoretically grounded framework that explains task vector arithmetic and introduces the task vector bases framework. Building upon existing task arithmetic literature, our method significantly reduces the memory cost for downstream arithmetic with little effort, while achieving competitive performance and maintaining compositional advantage, providing a practical solution for large-scale task arithmetic. The code is available at https://github.com/uiuctml/TaskVectorBasis.</p></details> | 27 pages, 11 figures |
| **[AlphaEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02355v4)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit hallucinations due to incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.7% with a single line of additional code for projection solely.

| **[NAACL2025 Tutorial: Adaptation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03931v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This tutorial on adaptation of LLMs is designed to address the growing demand for models that go beyond the static capabilities of generic LLMs by providing an overview of dynamic, domain-specific, and task-adaptive LLM adaptation techniques. While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.</p></details> | NAACL2025 Tutorial |

Timely disclosure and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in T2I models are crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of generative models. We explore a novel training-free backdoor poisoning paradigm through model editing, which is recently employed for knowledge updating in large language models. Nevertheless, we reveal the potential security risks posed by model editing techniques to image generation models. In this work, we establish the principles for backdoor attacks based on model editing, and propose a relationship-driven precise backdoor poisoning method, REDEditing. Drawing on the principles of equivalent-attribute alignment and stealthy poisoning, we develop an equivalent relationship retrieval and joint-attribute transfer approach that ensures consistent backdoor image generation through concept rebinding. A knowledge isolation constraint is proposed to preserve benign generation integrity. Our method achieves an 11\% higher attack success rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Remarkably, adding just one line of code enhances output naturalness while improving backdoor stealthiness by 24\%. This work aims to heighten awareness regarding this security vulnerability in editable image generation models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MemLLM: Finetuning LLMs to Use An Explicit Read-Write Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11672v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While current large language models (LLMs) perform well on many knowledge-related tasks, they are limited by relying on their parameters as an implicit storage mechanism. As a result, they struggle with memorizing rare events and with updating their memory as facts change over time. In addition, the uninterpretable nature of parametric memory makes it challenging to prevent hallucination. Model editing and augmenting LLMs with parameters specialized for memory are only partial solutions. In this paper, we introduce MemLLM, a novel method of enhancing LLMs by integrating a structured and explicit read-and-write memory module. MemLLM tackles the aforementioned challenges by enabling dynamic interaction with the memory and improving the LLM's capabilities in using stored knowledge. Our experiments indicate that MemLLM enhances the LLM's performance and interpretability, in language modeling in general and knowledge-intensive tasks in particular. We see MemLLM as an important step towards making LLMs more grounded and factual through memory augmentation.

| **[Pretraining Language Models for Diachronic Linguistic Change Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05523v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential as tools for scientific discovery. This has engendered growing interest in their use in humanistic disciplines, such as historical linguistics and literary studies. These fields often construct arguments on the basis of delineations like genre, or more inflexibly, time period. Although efforts have been made to restrict inference to specific domains via fine-tuning or model editing, we posit that the only true guarantee is domain-restricted pretraining -- typically, a data- and compute-expensive proposition. We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches. We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices. We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned. We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus. Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields. Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence. We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Definitions and Distributed Reasoning: A Proof-of-Concept Mechanistic Interpretability Study via Activation Patching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02976v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the localization of knowledge representation in fine-tuned GPT-2 models using Causal Layer Attribution via Activation Patching (CLAP), a method that identifies critical neural layers responsible for correct answer generation. The model was fine-tuned on 9,958 PubMed abstracts (epilepsy: 20,595 mentions, EEG: 11,674 mentions, seizure: 13,921 mentions) using two configurations with validation loss monitoring for early stopping. CLAP involved (1) caching clean (correct answer) and corrupted (incorrect answer) activations, (2) computing logit difference to quantify model preference, and (3) patching corrupted activations with clean ones to assess recovery. Results revealed three findings: First, patching the first feedforward layer recovered 56% of correct preference, demonstrating that associative knowledge is distributed across multiple layers. Second, patching the final output layer completely restored accuracy (100% recovery), indicating that definitional knowledge is localised. The stronger clean logit difference for definitional questions further supports this localized representation. Third, minimal recovery from convolutional layer patching (13.6%) suggests low-level features contribute marginally to high-level reasoning. Statistical analysis confirmed significant layer-specific effects (p<0.01). These findings demonstrate that factual knowledge is more localized and associative knowledge depends on distributed representations. We also showed that editing efficacy depends on task type. Our findings not only reconcile conflicting observations about localization in model editing but also emphasize on using task-adaptive techniques for reliable, interpretable updates.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Efficient Model Editing with Task-Localized Sparse Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02620v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic has emerged as a promising approach for editing models by representing task-specific knowledge as composable task vectors. However, existing methods rely on network linearization to derive task vectors, leading to computational bottlenecks during training and inference. Moreover, linearization alone does not ensure weight disentanglement, the key property that enables conflict-free composition of task vectors. To address this, we propose TaLoS which allows to build sparse task vectors with minimal interference without requiring explicit linearization and sharing information across tasks. We find that pre-trained models contain a subset of parameters with consistently low gradient sensitivity across tasks, and that sparsely updating only these parameters allows for promoting weight disentanglement during fine-tuning. Our experiments prove that TaLoS improves training and inference efficiency while outperforming current methods in task addition and negation. By enabling modular parameter editing, our approach fosters practical deployment of adaptable foundation models in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ICLR 2025 - https://github.com/iurada/talos-task-arithmetic</p></details> |
| **[Leaking LoRa: An Evaluation of Password Leaks and Knowledge Storage in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00031v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To effectively deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) in application-specific settings, fine-tuning techniques are applied to enhance performance on specialized tasks. This process often involves fine-tuning on user data data, which may contain sensitive information. Although not recommended, it is not uncommon for users to send passwords in messages, and fine-tuning models on this could result in passwords being leaked. In this study, a Large Language Model is fine-tuned with customer support data and passwords from the RockYou password wordlist using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Out of the first 200 passwords from the list, 37 were successfully recovered. Further, causal tracing is used to identify that password information is largely located in a few layers. Lastly, Rank One Model Editing (ROME) is used to remove the password information from the model, resulting in the number of passwords recovered going from 37 to 0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Lifelong Editing for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05759v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) acquire information from pre-training corpora, but their stored knowledge can become inaccurate or outdated over time. Model editing addresses this challenge by modifying model parameters without retraining, and prevalent approaches leverage hypernetworks to generate these parameter updates. However, they face significant challenges in lifelong editing due to their incompatibility with LLM parameters that dynamically change during the editing process. To address this, we observed that hypernetwork-based lifelong editing aligns with reinforcement learning modeling and proposed RLEdit, an RL-based editing method. By treating editing losses as rewards and optimizing hypernetwork parameters at the full knowledge sequence level, we enable it to precisely capture LLM changes and generate appropriate parameter updates. Our extensive empirical evaluation across several LLMs demonstrates that RLEdit outperforms existing methods in lifelong editing with superior effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 59.24% improvement while requiring only 2.11% of the time compared to most approaches.

| **[AnyEdit: Edit Any Knowledge Encoded in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05628v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single token's hidden state, a limitation we term "efficacy barrier". To solve this, we propose AnyEdit, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new EditEverything dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Model Editing for LLM-based Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15117v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims at selectively updating a small subset of a neural model's parameters with an interpretable strategy to achieve desired modifications. It can significantly reduce computational costs to adapt to large language models (LLMs). Given its ability to precisely target critical components within LLMs, model editing shows great potential for efficient fine-tuning applications. In this work, we investigate model editing to serve an efficient method for adapting LLMs to solve aspect-based sentiment classification. Through causal interventions, we trace and determine which neuron hidden states are essential for the prediction of the model. By performing interventions and restorations on each component of an LLM, we identify the importance of these components for aspect-based sentiment classification. Our findings reveal that a distinct set of mid-layer representations is essential for detecting the sentiment polarity of given aspect words. Leveraging these insights, we develop a model editing approach that focuses exclusively on these critical parts of the LLM, leading to a more efficient method for adapting LLMs. Our in-domain and out-of-domain experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves competitive results compared to the currently strongest methods with significantly fewer trainable parameters, highlighting a more efficient and interpretable fine-tuning strategy.</p></details> | AAAI2025 |

This paper strategically identifies the need for linguistic equity by examining several knowledge editing techniques in multilingual contexts. We evaluate the performance of models such as Mistral, TowerInstruct, OpenHathi, Tamil-Llama, and Kan-Llama across languages including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Hindi, Tamil, and Kannada. Our research identifies significant discrepancies in normal and merged models concerning cross-lingual consistency. We employ strategies like 'each language for itself' (ELFI) and 'each language for others' (ELFO) to stress-test these models. Our findings demonstrate the potential for LLMs to overcome linguistic barriers, laying the groundwork for future research in achieving linguistic inclusivity in AI technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 (Industry track)</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting Edited Large Language Models as General Scientific Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09620v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in mathematical optimization in scientific scenarios for their extensive knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. Existing methods mainly focus on utilizing LLMs to solve optimization problems in a prompt-based manner, which takes observational feedback as additional textual descriptions. However, due to LLM's \textbf{high sensitivity to the prompts} and \textbf{tendency to get lost in lengthy prompts}, these methods struggle to effectively utilize the {observational} feedback from each optimization step, which severely hinders the applications for real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptually simple and general {bi-level} optimization method, namely \textbf{G}eneral \textbf{S}cientific \textbf{O}ptimizers (GSO). Specifically, GSO first utilizes inner-level simulators as experimental platforms to evaluate the current solution and provide observational feedback. Then, LLMs serve as knowledgeable and versatile scientists, generating new solutions by refining potential errors from the feedback as the outer-level optimization. Finally, simulations together with the expert knowledge in LLMs are jointly updated with bi-level interactions via model editing. Extensive experiments show that GSO consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods using \textit{six} different LLM backbones on \textit{seven} different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forget Vectors at Play: Universal Input Perturbations Driving Machine Unlearning in Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16780v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning (MU), which seeks to erase the influence of specific unwanted data from already-trained models, is becoming increasingly vital in model editing, particularly to comply with evolving data regulations like the ``right to be forgotten''. Conventional approaches are predominantly model-based, typically requiring retraining or fine-tuning the model's weights to meet unlearning requirements. In this work, we approach the MU problem from a novel input perturbation-based perspective, where the model weights remain intact throughout the unlearning process. We demonstrate the existence of a proactive input-based unlearning strategy, referred to forget vector, which can be generated as an input-agnostic data perturbation and remains as effective as model-based approximate unlearning approaches. We also explore forget vector arithmetic, whereby multiple class-specific forget vectors are combined through simple operations (e.g., linear combinations) to generate new forget vectors for unseen unlearning tasks, such as forgetting arbitrary subsets across classes. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the forget vector, showcasing its competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art model-based methods.

| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Continuous Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03279v4)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct outdated or erroneous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without the need for costly retraining. Lifelong model editing is the most challenging task that caters to the continuous editing requirements of LLMs. Prior works primarily focus on single or batch editing; nevertheless, these methods fall short in lifelong editing scenarios due to catastrophic knowledge forgetting and the degradation of model performance. Although retrieval-based methods alleviate these issues, they are impeded by slow and cumbersome processes of integrating the retrieved knowledge into the model. In this work, we introduce RECIPE, a RetriEval-augmented ContInuous Prompt lEarning method, to boost editing efficacy and inference efficiency in lifelong learning. RECIPE first converts knowledge statements into short and informative continuous prompts, prefixed to the LLM's input query embedding, to efficiently refine the response grounded on the knowledge. It further integrates the Knowledge Sentinel (KS) that acts as an intermediary to calculate a dynamic threshold, determining whether the retrieval repository contains relevant knowledge. Our retriever and prompt encoder are jointly trained to achieve editing properties, i.e., reliability, generality, and locality. In our experiments, RECIPE is assessed extensively across multiple LLMs and editing datasets, where it achieves superior editing performance. RECIPE also demonstrates its capability to maintain the overall performance of LLMs alongside showcasing fast editing and inference speed.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 main |
| **[Lifelong Knowledge Editing for Vision Language Models with Low-Rank Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15432v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to correct inaccurate knowledge, update outdated information, and incorporate new data into Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for retraining. This task poses challenges in lifelong scenarios where edits must be continuously applied for real-world applications. While some editors demonstrate strong robustness for lifelong editing in pure LLMs, Vision LLMs (VLLMs), which incorporate an additional vision modality, are not directly adaptable to existing LLM editors. In this paper, we propose LiveEdit, a LIfelong Vision language modEl Edit to bridge the gap between lifelong LLM editing and VLLMs. We begin by training an editing expert generator to independently produce low-rank experts for each editing instance, with the goal of correcting the relevant responses of the VLLM. A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge, thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally, to integrate visually relevant experts, we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation, we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios. Further experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of each module design in LiveEdit.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Accepted |
| **[Unveiling Concept Attribution in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02542v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable abilities in generating realistic and high-quality images from text prompts. However, a trained model remains largely black-box; little do we know about the roles of its components in exhibiting a concept such as objects or styles. Recent works employ causal tracing to localize knowledge-storing layers in generative models without showing how other layers contribute to the target concept. In this work, we approach diffusion models' interpretability problem from a more general perspective and pose a question: \textit{``How do model components work jointly to demonstrate knowledge?''}. To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using component attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each component (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The proposed framework, called \textbf{C}omponent \textbf{A}ttribution for \textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing (positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components that contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the previous knowledge localization work. Based on this holistic understanding of diffusion models, we introduce two fast, inference-time model editing algorithms, CAD-Erase and CAD-Amplify; in particular, CAD-Erase enables erasure and CAD-Amplify allows amplification of a generated concept by ablating the positive and negative components, respectively, while retaining knowledge of other concepts. Extensive experimental results validate the significance of both positive and negative components pinpointed by our framework, demonstrating the potential of providing a complete view of interpreting generative models.

Existing debiasing strategies, such as retraining a model with counterfactual data, representation projection, and prompting often fail to efficiently eliminate bias or directly alter the models' biased internal representations. To address these issues, we propose BiasEdit, an efficient model editing method to remove stereotypical bias from language models through lightweight networks that act as editors to generate parameter updates. BiasEdit employs a debiasing loss guiding editor networks to conduct local edits on partial parameters of a language model for debiasing while preserving the language modeling abilities during editing through a retention loss. Experiments on StereoSet and Crows-Pairs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of BiasEdit in eliminating bias compared to tangental debiasing baselines and little to no impact on the language models' general capabilities. In addition, we conduct bias tracing to probe bias in various modules and explore bias editing impacts on different components of language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TrustNLP @ NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[SPEED: Scalable, Precise, and Efficient Concept Erasure for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07392v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. However, existing methods either require costly fine-tuning or degrade image quality for non-target concepts (i.e., prior) due to inherent optimization limitations. In this paper, we introduce SPEED, a model editing-based concept erasure approach that leverages null-space constraints for scalable, precise, and efficient erasure. Specifically, SPEED incorporates Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to retain the most affected non-target concepts during erasing, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to expand prior coverage while maintaining semantic consistency, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to regularize model editing by explicitly preserving key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in prior preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully removing 100 concepts within just 5 seconds.

Model editing has emerged as a prominent approach for updating LLMs' knowledge with minimal computational costs and parameter changes. This approach typically identifies and adjusts specific model parameters associated with newly acquired knowledge. However, existing methods often underestimate the adverse effects that parameter modifications can have on broadly distributed knowledge. More critically, post-edit LLMs frequently struggle with multi-hop reasoning and continuous knowledge updates. Although various studies have discussed these shortcomings, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we provide an evaluation of ten model editing methods along four dimensions: reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Results confirm that all ten popular model editing methods show significant shortcomings across multiple dimensions, suggesting model editing is less promising. We then propose a straightforward method called Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR), for knowledge updating. SCR does not modify model parameters but harnesses LLM's inherent contextual reasoning capabilities utilizing the updated knowledge pieces. Under SCR, an LLM first assesses whether an incoming query falls within the scope of an external knowledge base. If it does, the relevant external knowledge texts are contextualized to enhance reasoning; otherwise, the query is answered directly. We evaluate SCR against the ten model editing methods on two counterfactual datasets with three backbone LLMs. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of contextual reasoning for knowledge updating.</p></details> |  |

While model editing has been proposed to remove or filter undesirable concepts in embedding and latent spaces, it can inadvertently damage learned manifolds, distorting concepts in close semantic proximity. We identify limitations in current model editing techniques, showing that even benign, proximal concepts may become misaligned. To address the need for safe content generation, we leverage safe embeddings and a modified diffusion process with tunable weighted summation in the latent space to generate safer images. Our method preserves global context without compromising the structural integrity of the learned manifolds. We achieve state-of-the-art results on safe image generation benchmarks and offer intuitive control over the level of model safety. We identify trade-offs between safety and censorship, which presents a necessary perspective in the development of ethical AI models. We will release our code.

| **[Perturbation-Restrained Sequential Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16821v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing is an emerging field that focuses on updating the knowledge embedded within large language models (LLMs) without extensive retraining. However, current model editing methods significantly compromise the general abilities of LLMs as the number of edits increases, and this trade-off poses a substantial challenge to the continual learning of LLMs. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze that the factor affecting the general abilities in sequential model editing lies in the condition number of the edited matrix. The condition number of a matrix represents its numerical sensitivity, and therefore can be used to indicate the extent to which the original knowledge associations stored in LLMs are perturbed after editing. Subsequently, statistical findings demonstrate that the value of this factor becomes larger as the number of edits increases, thereby exacerbating the deterioration of general abilities. To this end, a framework termed Perturbation Restraint on Upper bouNd for Editing (PRUNE) is proposed, which applies the condition number restraints in sequential editing. These restraints can lower the upper bound on perturbation to edited models, thus preserving the general abilities. Systematically, we conduct experiments employing three editing methods on three LLMs across four downstream tasks. The results show that PRUNE can preserve general abilities while maintaining the editing performance effectively in sequential model editing. The code are available at https://github.com/mjy1111/PRUNE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods are both computationally intensive and lacking in controllability and transparency, inhibiting their widespread use. Furthermore, these tuning-based methods require large-scale preference data for training and are susceptible to noisy preference data. In this paper, we introduce a tuning-free alignment alternative, ProFS (Projection Filter for Subspaces), and demonstrate its effectiveness under the use case of toxicity reduction. Grounded on theory from factor analysis, ProFS is a sample-efficient model editing approach that identifies a toxic subspace in the model parameter space and reduces model toxicity by projecting away the detected subspace. The toxic subspace is identified by extracting preference data embeddings from the language model, and removing non-toxic information from these embeddings. We show that ProFS is more sample-efficient than DPO, further showcasing greater robustness to noisy data. Finally, we attempt to connect tuning based alignment with editing, by establishing both theoretical and empirical connections between ProFS and DPO, showing that ProFS can be interpreted as a denoised version of a single DPO step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Knowledge-based model editing enables precise modifications to the weights of large language models in order to modify the information encoded within. Recent approaches have seen success in enabling recall of edited information for thousands of edits at once. However, these approaches fail to produce edits that account for associated contextual information. We present K-Edit, an effective approach to generating contextually consistent knowledge edits. By using knowledge graphs, which maintain contextual consistency when an edge is edited, we are able to generate additional \textit{contextual edits} that ensure consistency of related information in the language model. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in multi-hop question answering while maintaining the general effectiveness and scalability of model edits.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Lens for Evaluating Faithfulness Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18848v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's internal reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, a unified evaluation framework remains absent. To address this gap, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of causal diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate a variety of faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that all tested faithfulness metrics often fail to surpass a random baseline. Our work underscores the need for improved metrics and more reliable interpretability methods in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 18 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Constraining Sequential Model Editing with Editing Anchor Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00035v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) struggle with hallucinations due to false or outdated knowledge. Given the high resource demands of retraining these models, there is an increasing focus on developing model editing. However, the general abilities of LLMs across downstream tasks are prone to significant degradation during sequential editing. This paper statistically observes that the parameter matrix after editing exhibits a significant deviation compared to its previous state as the number of edits increases. This serious deviation affects the original knowledge associations within LLMs and leads to the degradation of their general abilities. To this end, a framework termed Editing Anchor Compression (EAC) is proposed to constrain the deviation of the parameter matrix during sequential editing. It compresses the editing information by selecting editing anchors that are important in encoding new relations without deviating too much from the original matrix, thereby preserving the general abilities. Experiments of applying EAC to two popular editing methods on three LLMs across four tasks are conducted. Evaluation results show that EAC effectively minimizes unreasonable deviations caused by model editing, preserving over 70% of the general abilities while better retaining the editing knowledge compared to the original counterpart methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Updatable Large Language Models by Integrating Context into Model Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00487v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), the rapid and frequent integration of small-scale experiences, such as interactions with surrounding objects, remains a substantial challenge. Two critical factors in assimilating these experiences are (1) Efficacy: the ability to accurately remember recent events; (2) Retention: the capacity to recall long-past experiences. Current methods either embed experiences within model parameters using continual learning, model editing, or knowledge distillation techniques, which often struggle with rapid updates and complex interactions, or rely on external storage to achieve long-term retention, thereby increasing storage requirements. In this paper, we propose SELF-PARAM (Self-Updatable Large Language Models with Parameter Integration). SELF-PARAM requires no extra parameters while ensuring near-optimal efficacy and long-term retention. Our method employs a training objective that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predictions of an original model (with access to contextual information) and a target model (without such access). By generating diverse question-answer pairs related to the knowledge and minimizing the KL divergence across this dataset, we update the target model to internalize the knowledge seamlessly within its parameters. Evaluations on question-answering and conversational recommendation tasks demonstrate that SELF-PARAM significantly outperforms existing methods, even when accounting for non-zero storage requirements. This advancement paves the way for more efficient and scalable integration of experiences in large language models by embedding knowledge directly into model parameters.</p></details> |  |

While model editing methods have been developed to address such errors without full re-training, they frequently suffer from knowledge conflicts, where outdated information interferes with new knowledge. In this work, we propose Conflict-free Model Editing (CoME), a novel framework that enhances the accuracy of knowledge updates in LLMs by selectively removing outdated knowledge. CoME leverages unlearning to mitigate knowledge interference, allowing new information to be integrated without compromising relevant linguistic features. Through experiments on GPT-J and LLaMA-3 using Counterfact and ZsRE datasets, we demonstrate that CoME improves both editing accuracy and model reliability when applied to existing editing methods. Our results highlight that the targeted removal of outdated knowledge is crucial for enhancing model editing effectiveness and maintaining the model's generative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift by designing an architecture to memorize text directly, bearing in mind the principle that memorization precedes learning. We introduce MeMo, a novel architecture for language modeling that explicitly memorizes sequences of tokens in layered associative memories. By design, MeMo offers transparency and the possibility of model editing, including forgetting texts. We experimented with the MeMo architecture, showing the memorization power of the one-layer and the multi-layer configurations.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides an overview of state-of-the-art methods for expanding the knowledge of LLMs, focusing on integrating various knowledge types, including factual information, domain expertise, language proficiency, and user preferences.

Designed as a guide for researchers and practitioners, this survey sheds light on opportunities for advancing LLMs as adaptable and robust knowledge systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWEA: Updating Factual Knowledge in Large Language Models via Subject Word Embedding Altering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17809v4)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The general capabilities of large language models (LLMs) make them the infrastructure for various AI applications, but updating their inner knowledge requires significant resources. Recent model editing is a promising technique for efficiently updating a small amount of knowledge of LLMs and has attracted much attention. In particular, local editing methods, which directly update model parameters, are proven suitable for updating small amounts of knowledge. Local editing methods update weights by computing least squares closed-form solutions and identify edited knowledge by vector-level matching in inference, which achieve promising results. However, these methods still require a lot of time and resources to complete the computation. Moreover, vector-level matching lacks reliability, and such updates disrupt the original organization of the model's parameters. To address these issues, we propose a detachable and expandable Subject Word Embedding Altering (SWEA) framework, which finds the editing embeddings through token-level matching and adds them to the subject word embeddings in Transformer input. To get these editing embeddings, we propose optimizing then suppressing fusion method, which first optimizes learnable embedding vectors for the editing target and then suppresses the Knowledge Embedding Dimensions (KEDs) to obtain final editing embeddings. We thus propose SWEA$\oplus$OS method for editing factual knowledge in LLMs. We demonstrate the overall state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of SWEA$\oplus$OS on the CounterFact and zsRE datasets. To further validate the reasoning ability of SWEA$\oplus$OS in editing knowledge, we evaluate it on the more complex RippleEdits benchmark. The results demonstrate that SWEA$\oplus$OS possesses SOTA reasoning ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI2...</summary><p>AAAI25.

| **[Large Scale Knowledge Washing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16720v3)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models show impressive abilities in memorizing world knowledge, which leads to concerns regarding memorization of private information, toxic or sensitive knowledge, and copyrighted content. We introduce the problem of Large Scale Knowledge Washing, focusing on unlearning an extensive amount of factual knowledge. Previous unlearning methods usually define the reverse loss and update the model via backpropagation, which may affect the model's fluency and reasoning ability or even destroy the model due to extensive training with the reverse loss. Existing works introduce additional data from downstream tasks to prevent the model from losing capabilities, which requires downstream task awareness. Controlling the tradeoff of unlearning and maintaining existing capabilities is also challenging. To this end, we propose LAW (Large Scale Washing) to update the MLP layers in decoder-only large language models to perform knowledge washing, as inspired by model editing methods and based on the hypothesis that knowledge and reasoning are disentanglable. We derive a new objective with the knowledge to be unlearned to update the weights of certain MLP layers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LAW in forgetting target knowledge while maintaining reasoning ability. The code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/wangyu-ustc/LargeScaleWashing.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TimeDiT, a diffusion transformer model that synergistically combines transformer-based temporal dependency learning with diffusion-based probabilistic sampling. TimeDiT employs a unified masking mechanism to harmonize the training and inference process across diverse tasks while introducing a theoretically grounded, finetuning-free model editing strategy that enables flexible integration of external knowledge during sampling. Acknowledging the challenges of unifying multiple downstream tasks under a single model, our systematic evaluation demonstrates TimeDiT's effectiveness both in fundamental tasks, i.e., forecasting and imputation, through zero-shot/fine-tuning; and in domain tasks, i.e., multi-resolution forecasting, anomaly detection, and data generation, establishing it as a \textit{proto-foundation model} that bridges the gap between general-purpose and domain-specific models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 11 Figures, 22 Tables.

Current approaches either provide interpretable features without the ability to test their causal influence, or enable model editing without interpretable controls. We present a unified framework using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that bridges this gap, allowing us to discover human-interpretable visual features and precisely manipulate them to test hypotheses about model behavior. By applying our method to state-of-the-art vision models, we reveal key differences in the semantic abstractions learned by models with different pre-training objectives. We then demonstrate the practical usage of our framework through controlled interventions across multiple vision tasks. We show that SAEs can reliably identify and manipulate interpretable visual features without model re-training, providing a powerful tool for understanding and controlling vision model behavior. We provide code, demos and models on our project website: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SAE-V.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text is 11 pages with 7 figures</p></details> |

Detecting Knowledge Edits in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02765v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing methods (KEs) can update language models' obsolete or inaccurate knowledge learned from pre-training. However, KEs can be used for malicious applications, e.g., inserting misinformation and toxic content. Knowing whether a generated output is based on edited knowledge or first-hand knowledge from pre-training can increase users' trust in generative models and provide more transparency. Driven by this, we propose a novel task: detecting edited knowledge in language models. Given an edited model and a fact retrieved by a prompt from an edited model, the objective is to classify the knowledge as either unedited (based on the pre-training), or edited (based on subsequent editing). We instantiate the task with four KEs, two LLMs, and two datasets. Additionally, we propose using the hidden state representations and the probability distributions as features for the detection. Our results reveal that, using these features as inputs to a simple AdaBoost classifiers establishes a strong baseline. This classifier requires only a limited amount of data and maintains its performance even in cross-domain settings. Last, we find it more challenging to distinguish edited knowledge from unedited but related knowledge, highlighting the need for further research. Our work lays the groundwork for addressing malicious model editing, which is a critical challenge associated with the strong generative capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL Main 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods rely on the crafting of poisoned datasets and the time-consuming process of fine-tuning. In this work, we propose JailbreakEdit, a novel jailbreak backdoor injection method that exploits model editing techniques to inject a universal jailbreak backdoor into safety-aligned LLMs with minimal intervention in minutes. JailbreakEdit integrates a multi-node target estimation to estimate the jailbreak space, thus creating shortcuts from the backdoor to this estimated jailbreak space that induce jailbreak actions. Our attack effectively shifts the models' attention by attaching strong semantics to the backdoor, enabling it to bypass internal safety mechanisms. Experimental results show that JailbreakEdit achieves a high jailbreak success rate on jailbreak prompts while preserving generation quality, and safe performance on normal queries. Our findings underscore the effectiveness, stealthiness, and explainability of JailbreakEdit, emphasizing the need for more advanced defense mechanisms in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This not only showcases their current effectiveness but also sets a promising trajectory towards the development of artificial general intelligence. Unfortunately, due to multiple constraints, the raw data of the model used for large model training are often inaccessible, so the use of end-to-end models for downstream tasks has become a new research trend, which we call Learn From Model (LFM) in this article. LFM focuses on the research, modification, and design of FM based on the model interface, so as to better understand the model structure and weights (in a black box environment), and to generalize the model to downstream tasks. The study of LFM techniques can be broadly categorized into five major areas: model tuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta learning and model editing. Each category encompasses a repertoire of methods and strategies that aim to enhance the capabilities and performance of FM. This paper gives a comprehensive review of the current methods based on FM from the perspective of LFM, in order to help readers better understand the current research status and ideas. To conclude, we summarize the survey by highlighting several critical areas for future exploration and addressing open issues that require further attention from the research community.

Locate-then-edit methods are a popular class of approaches that first identify the critical layers storing knowledge, then compute the residual of the last critical layer based on the edited knowledge, and finally perform multi-layer updates using a least-squares solution by evenly distributing the residual from the first critical layer to the last. Although these methods achieve promising results, they have been shown to degrade the original knowledge of LLMs. We argue that residual distribution leads to this issue. To explore this, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of residual distribution in locate-then-edit methods from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, revealing that residual distribution introduces editing errors, leading to inaccurate edits. To address this issue, we propose the Boundary Layer UpdatE (BLUE) strategy to enhance locate-then-edit methods. Sequential batch editing experiments on three LLMs and two datasets demonstrate that BLUE not only delivers an average performance improvement of 35.59\%, significantly advancing the state of the art in model editing, but also enhances the preservation of LLMs' general capabilities.

Recent research discovered that the mid-layer representation of the subject's final token in a prompt has a strong influence on factual predictions, and developed Large Language Model (LLM) editing techniques based on this observation. However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, model editing for VLLMs has not been extensively studied in the literature. In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt. We evaluated VisEdit using multiple VLLM backbones and public VLLM editing benchmark datasets. The results show the superiority of VisEdit over the strong baselines adapted from existing state-of-the-art editors for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI-2025 as an oral presentation</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Semantic Consistency of Large Language Models through Model Editing: An Interpretability-Oriented Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11041v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Large Language Model (LLM) tends to generate inconsistent and sometimes contradictory outputs when presented with a prompt that has equivalent semantics but is expressed differently from the original prompt. To achieve semantic consistency of an LLM, one of the key approaches is to finetune the model with prompt-output pairs with semantically equivalent meanings. Despite its effectiveness, a data-driven finetuning method incurs substantial computation costs in data preparation and model optimization. In this regime, an LLM is treated as a ``black box'', restricting our ability to gain deeper insights into its internal mechanism. In this paper, we are motivated to enhance the semantic consistency of LLMs through a more interpretable method (i.e., model editing) to this end. We first identify the model components (i.e., attention heads) that have a key impact on the semantic consistency of an LLM. We subsequently inject biases into the output of these model components along the semantic-consistency activation direction. It is noteworthy that these modifications are cost-effective, without reliance on mass manipulations of the original model parameters. Through comprehensive experiments on the constructed NLU and open-source NLG datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvements in the semantic consistency and task performance of LLMs. Additionally, our method exhibits promising generalization capabilities by performing well on tasks beyond the primary tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELDER: Enhancing Lifelong Model Editing with Mixture-of-LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11869v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) require model editing to efficiently update specific knowledge within them and avoid factual errors. Most model editing methods are solely designed for single-time use and result in a significant forgetting effect in lifelong editing scenarios, where sequential edits are conducted over time. Previous approaches manage sequential edits by freezing original parameters and discretely allocating new parameters for each knowledge update. However, these methods lack robustness to minor input variations due to the discrete mapping between data and parameters. To overcome this challenge, we propose ELDER, a novel approach to create a continuous association between data and adapters. ELDER integrates multiple LoRAs through a router network and is trained to establish a smooth data-adapter association, thereby enhancing the edit robustness and generalization of semantically equivalent inputs. To ensure inputs containing the same knowledge will be processed by the same LoRAs, we design a novel loss to guide the model link LoRA allocations with edit knowledge. Furthermore, we propose a deferral mechanism to retain the original LLM capabilities post-edit. Extensive experiments on GPT-2 XL and LLaMA2-7B demonstrate that ELDER effectively edits models in the lifelong setting, outperforming eight baselines while exhibiting strong scalability and preserving LLMs' general abilities on downstream tasks.

| **[WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14768v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

These methods can be used for malicious applications such as inserting misinformation or simple trojans that result in adversary-specified behaviors when a trigger word is present. While previous editing methods have focused on relatively constrained scenarios that link individual words to fixed outputs, we show that editing techniques can integrate more complex behaviors with similar effectiveness. We develop Concept-ROT, a model editing-based method that efficiently inserts trojans which not only exhibit complex output behaviors, but also trigger on high-level concepts -- presenting an entirely new class of trojan attacks. Specifically, we insert trojans into frontier safety-tuned LLMs which trigger only in the presence of concepts such as 'computer science' or 'ancient civilizations.' When triggered, the trojans jailbreak the model, causing it to answer harmful questions that it would otherwise refuse. Our results further motivate concerns over the practicality and potential ramifications of trojan attacks on Machine Learning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Editing-Based Jailbreak against Safety-aligned Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08201v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed numerous fields by enabling advanced natural language interactions but remain susceptible to critical vulnerabilities, particularly jailbreak attacks. Current jailbreak techniques, while effective, often depend on input modifications, making them detectable and limiting their stealth and scalability. This paper presents Targeted Model Editing (TME), a novel white-box approach that bypasses safety filters by minimally altering internal model structures while preserving the model's intended functionalities. TME identifies and removes safety-critical transformations (SCTs) embedded in model matrices, enabling malicious queries to bypass restrictions without input modifications. By analyzing distinct activation patterns between safe and unsafe queries, TME isolates and approximates SCTs through an optimization process. Implemented in the D-LLM framework, our method achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.86% on four mainstream open-source LLMs, maintaining high performance. Unlike existing methods, D-LLM eliminates the need for specific triggers or harmful response collections, offering a stealthier and more effective jailbreak strategy. This work reveals a covert and robust threat vector in LLM security and emphasizes the need for stronger safeguards in model safety alignment.</p></details> |  |

This initiative aims to eliminate undesirable data influence (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) and the associated model capabilities, while maintaining the integrity of essential knowledge generation and not affecting causally unrelated information. We envision LLM unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of LLMs, potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing generative AI that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining. We navigate the unlearning landscape in LLMs from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications. In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing LLM unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment. We also draw connections between LLM unlearning and related areas such as model editing, influence functions, model explanation, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we outline an effective assessment framework for LLM unlearning and explore its applications in copyright and privacy safeguards and sociotechnical harm reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Nature Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Model Editing for LLMs4Code: How Far are We?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06638v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models for Code (LLMs4Code) have been found to exhibit outstanding performance in the software engineering domain, especially the remarkable performance in coding tasks. However, even the most advanced LLMs4Code can inevitably contain incorrect or outdated code knowledge. Due to the high cost of training LLMs4Code, it is impractical to re-train the models for fixing these problematic code knowledge. Model editing is a new technical field for effectively and efficiently correcting erroneous knowledge in LLMs, where various model editing techniques and benchmarks have been proposed recently. Despite that, a comprehensive study that thoroughly compares and analyzes the performance of the state-of-the-art model editing techniques for adapting the knowledge within LLMs4Code across various code-related tasks is notably absent. To bridge this gap, we perform the first systematic study on applying state-of-the-art model editing approaches to repair the inaccuracy of LLMs4Code. To that end, we introduce a benchmark named CLMEEval, which consists of two datasets, i.e., CoNaLa-Edit (CNLE) with 21K+ code generation samples and CodeSearchNet-Edit (CSNE) with 16K+ code summarization samples. With the help of CLMEEval, we evaluate six advanced model editing techniques on three LLMs4Code: CodeLlama (7B), CodeQwen1.5 (7B), and Stable-Code (3B). Our findings include that the external memorization-based GRACE approach achieves the best knowledge editing effectiveness and specificity (the editing does not influence untargeted knowledge), while generalization (whether the editing can generalize to other semantically-identical inputs) is a universal challenge for existing techniques. Furthermore, building on in-depth case analysis, we introduce an enhanced version of GRACE called A-GRACE, which incorporates contrastive learning to better capture the semantics of the inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE2025.

Unveiling the vulnerabilities of safety guardrails to harmful queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15302v5)** | 2024-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we tackle a growing concern around the safety and ethical use of large language models (LLMs). Despite their potential, these models can be tricked into producing harmful or unethical content through various sophisticated methods, including 'jailbreaking' techniques and targeted manipulation. Our work zeroes in on a specific issue: to what extent LLMs can be led astray by asking them to generate responses that are instruction-centric such as a pseudocode, a program or a software snippet as opposed to vanilla text. To investigate this question, we introduce TechHazardQA, a dataset containing complex queries which should be answered in both text and instruction-centric formats (e.g., pseudocodes), aimed at identifying triggers for unethical responses. We query a series of LLMs -- Llama-2-13b, Llama-2-7b, Mistral-V2 and Mistral 8X7B -- and ask them to generate both text and instruction-centric responses. For evaluation we report the harmfulness score metric as well as judgements from GPT-4 and humans. Overall, we observe that asking LLMs to produce instruction-centric responses enhances the unethical response generation by ~2-38% across the models. As an additional objective, we investigate the impact of model editing using the ROME technique, which further increases the propensity for generating undesirable content. In particular, asking edited LLMs to generate instruction-centric responses further increases the unethical response generation by ~3-16% across the different models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2025.

However, these high-dimensional, dense vector representations are not easily interpretable, limiting our understanding of the rich structure of CLIP and its use in downstream applications that require transparency. In this work, we show that the semantic structure of CLIP's latent space can be leveraged to provide interpretability, allowing for the decomposition of representations into semantic concepts. We formulate this problem as one of sparse recovery and propose a novel method, Sparse Linear Concept Embeddings, for transforming CLIP representations into sparse linear combinations of human-interpretable concepts. Distinct from previous work, SpLiCE is task-agnostic and can be used, without training, to explain and even replace traditional dense CLIP representations, maintaining high downstream performance while significantly improving their interpretability. We also demonstrate significant use cases of SpLiCE representations including detecting spurious correlations and model editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 15 figures, NeurIPS 2024.

While significant progress has been made in editing Transformer-based large language models, effective strategies for editing vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision remain largely untapped. In this paper, we take initial steps towards correcting predictive errors of ViTs, particularly those arising from subpopulation shifts. Taking a locate-then-edit approach, we first address the where-to-edit challenge by meta-learning a hypernetwork on CutMix-augmented data generated for editing reliability. This trained hypernetwork produces generalizable binary masks that identify a sparse subset of structured model parameters, responsive to real-world failure samples. Afterward, we solve the how-to-edit problem by simply fine-tuning the identified parameters using a variant of gradient descent to achieve successful edits. To validate our method, we construct an editing benchmark that introduces subpopulation shifts towards natural underrepresented images and AI-generated images, thereby revealing the limitations of pre-trained ViTs for object recognition. Our approach not only achieves superior performance on the proposed benchmark but also allows for adjustable trade-offs between generalization and locality.

However, applying these models to real-world mobile scenarios remains a significant challenge due to the long-horizon task execution, difficulty in error recovery, and the cold-start problem in unfamiliar environments. To address these challenges, we propose MobileUse, a GUI agent designed for robust and adaptive mobile task execution. To improve resilience in long-horizon tasks and dynamic environments, we introduce a hierarchical reflection architecture that enables the agent to self-monitor, detect, and recover from errors across multiple temporal scales-ranging from individual actions to overall task completion-while maintaining efficiency through a reflection-on-demand strategy. To tackle cold-start issues, we further introduce a proactive exploration module, which enriches the agent's understanding of the environment through self-planned exploration. Evaluations on AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks demonstrate that MobileUse establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving success rates of 62.9% and 44.2%, respectively. To facilitate real-world applications, we release an out-of-the-box toolkit for automated task execution on physical mobile devices, which is available at https://github.com/MadeAgents/mobile-use.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report on a GUI agent based on multi-agent systems</p></details> |

To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Test-time Scaling for GUI Agent Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00684v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy. To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.

| **[OS-Kairos: Adaptive Interaction for MLLM-Powered GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16465v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models have shown great promise. However, a critical yet underexplored issue persists: over-execution, where the agent executes tasks in a fully autonomous way, without adequate assessment of its action confidence to compromise an adaptive human-agent collaboration. This poses substantial risks in complex scenarios, such as those involving ambiguous user instructions, unexpected interruptions, and environmental hijacks. To address the issue, we introduce OS-Kairos, an adaptive GUI agent capable of predicting confidence levels at each interaction step and efficiently deciding whether to act autonomously or seek human intervention. OS-Kairos is developed through two key mechanisms: (i) collaborative probing that annotates confidence scores at each interaction step; (ii) confidence-driven interaction that leverages these confidence scores to elicit the ability of adaptive interaction. Experimental results show that OS-Kairos substantially outperforms existing models on our curated dataset featuring complex scenarios, as well as on established benchmarks such as AITZ and Meta-GUI, with 24.59\%$\sim$87.29\% improvements in task success rate. OS-Kairos facilitates an adaptive human-agent collaboration, prioritizing effectiveness, generality, scalability, and efficiency for real-world GUI interaction. The dataset and codes are available at https://github.com/Wuzheng02/OS-Kairos.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 24 figures, 11 tables (ACL 2025, Findings)</p></details> |
| **[LaSM: Layer-wise Scaling Mechanism for Defending Pop-up Attack on GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10610v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong decision-making abilities in screen-based interaction tasks. However, they remain highly vulnerable to pop-up-based environmental injection attacks, where malicious visual elements divert model attention and lead to unsafe or incorrect actions. Existing defense methods either require costly retraining or perform poorly under inductive interference. In this work, we systematically study how such attacks alter the attention behavior of GUI agents and uncover a layer-wise attention divergence pattern between correct and incorrect outputs. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{LaSM}, a \textit{Layer-wise Scaling Mechanism} that selectively amplifies attention and MLP modules in critical layers. LaSM improves the alignment between model saliency and task-relevant regions without additional training. Extensive experiments across 12 types of pop-up perturbations and 4 different model backbones show that LaSM consistently enhances the defense success rate. When combined with prompt-level alerts, LaSM achieves over 98\% robustness even under strong inductive attacks. Our findings reveal that attention misalignment is a core vulnerability in MLLM agents and can be effectively addressed through selective layer-wise modulation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |
| **[GTA1: GUI Test-time Scaling Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05791v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms (e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements. Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step. However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning (i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual targets. This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning (RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments, rewarding successful clicks on interface elements. Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7% accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisualTrap: A Stealthy Backdoor Attack on GUI Agents via Visual Grounding Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06899v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets. VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover, the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments, e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments. These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor attack risks in GUI agents.</p></details> |  |

These agents interpret raw GUI screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment. We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii) adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[R-VLM: Region-Aware Vision Language Model for Precise GUI Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05673v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual agent models for automating human activities on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have emerged as a promising research direction, driven by advances in large Vision Language Models (VLMs). A critical challenge in GUI automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives, which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13% across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.</p></details> | ACL 2025; 17 pages |

Despite notable advancements, their resilience in real-world scenarios where screen content may be partially manipulated by untrustworthy third parties remains largely unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58 reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content, while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14 popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess training-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents. Our code and data will be released at https://agenthazard.github.io.</p></details> |  |

We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components, SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances. Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

A general scenario is proposed where both the user and the agent are benign, and the environment, while not malicious, contains unrelated content. A wide range of MLLMs are evaluated as GUI agents using a simulated dataset, following three working patterns with different levels of perception. Experimental results reveal that even the most powerful models, whether generalist agents or specialist GUI agents, are susceptible to distractions. While recent studies predominantly focus on the helpfulness of agents, our findings first indicate that these agents are prone to environmental distractions. Furthermore, we implement an adversarial environment injection and analyze the approach to improve faithfulness, calling for a collective focus on this important topic.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

While API-based LLM agents initially rose to prominence for their robust automation capabilities and seamless integration with programmatic endpoints, recent progress in multimodal LLM research has enabled GUI-based LLM agents that interact with graphical user interfaces in a human-like manner. Although these two paradigms share the goal of enabling LLM-driven task automation, they diverge significantly in architectural complexity, development workflows, and user interaction models. This paper presents the first comprehensive comparative study of API-based and GUI-based LLM agents, systematically analyzing their divergence and potential convergence. We examine key dimensions and highlight scenarios in which hybrid approaches can harness their complementary strengths. By proposing clear decision criteria and illustrating practical use cases, we aim to guide practitioners and researchers in selecting, combining, or transitioning between these paradigms. Ultimately, we indicate that continuing innovations in LLM-based automation are poised to blur the lines between API- and GUI-driven agents, paving the way for more flexible, adaptive solutions in a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Memory: Enhancing GUI Agents for Cross-Application Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18158v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a self-supervised inverse dynamics task to enable VLMs to learn from GUI transition pairs by inferring the action that caused that transition. This training task offers two advantages: (1) It enables VLMs to ignore variations unrelated to user actions (e.g., background refreshes, ads) and to focus on true affordances such as buttons and input fields within complex GUIs. (2) The training data can be easily obtained from existing GUI trajectories without requiring human annotation, and it can be easily scaled through automatic offline exploration. Using this training task, we propose UI-shift, a framework for enhancing VLM-based GUI agents through self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL). With only 2K training samples sourced from existing datasets, two VLMs -- Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B -- trained with UI-Shift achieve competitive or superior performance on grounding tasks (ScreenSpot-series benchmarks) and GUI automation tasks (AndroidControl), compared to SFT baselines and GUI-specific models that explicitly elicit reasoning abilities during RL. Our findings suggest a potential direction for enhancing VLMs for GUI agents by leveraging more self-supervised training data in the future.

Despite their promising performance, these models frequently exhibit hallucinations-systematic localization errors that compromise reliability. We propose a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes model predictions into four distinct types, revealing nuanced failure modes beyond traditional accuracy metrics. To better quantify model uncertainty, we introduce the Peak Sharpness Score (PSS), a metric that evaluates the alignment between semantic continuity and logits distribution in coordinate prediction. Building on this insight, we further propose Context-Aware Cropping, a training-free technique that improves model performance by adaptively refining input context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework and methods provide actionable insights and enhance the interpretability and robustness of GUI agent behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the Digital World as Humans Do: Universal Visual Grounding for GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05243v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are transforming the capabilities of graphical user interface (GUI) agents, facilitating their transition from controlled simulations to complex, real-world applications across various platforms. However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 (Oral).

Despite their importance, existing datasets are often constructed under idealized conditions, overlooking the diverse anomalies frequently encountered in real-world deployments. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI-Robust, a novel dataset designed for comprehensive GUI agent evaluation, explicitly incorporating seven common types of anomalies observed in everyday GUI interactions. Furthermore, we propose a semi-automated dataset construction paradigm that collects user action sequences from natural interactions via RPA tools and then generate corresponding step and task descriptions for these actions with the assistance of MLLMs. This paradigm significantly reduces annotation time cost by a factor of over 19 times. Finally, we assess state-of-the-art GUI agents using the GUI-Robust dataset, revealing their substantial performance degradation in abnormal scenarios. We anticipate that our work will highlight the importance of robustness in GUI agents and inspires more future research in this direction.

However, practical deployment of such agents remains constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover, most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices. AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and $91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated results in Table 2 and Table 3; The project is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentCPM-GUI</p></details> |

Form filling is especially challenging in the pure-image domain without access to OCR, typeset PDF text, or a DOM. For computer agents, it requires multiple abilities, including multi-modal understanding, information retrieval, and tool-use. We present a novel form-filling benchmark consisting of 432 fields spread across 55 documents and 3 tasks, requiring knowledge of 236 features per user. We find that baseline VLAs achieve less than 1% accuracy in most cases, primarily due to poor localization ability. GUI agents also struggle, scoring between 10.6-68.0% despite high cost and latency. Therefore, we also contribute FieldFinder, a tool to assist LLMs in identifying where to place text on a form. With FieldFinder, all models achieve equal or better performance in all six study conditions, with a maximum increase from 2% to 56%.</p></details> |  |
| **[LPO: Towards Accurate GUI Agent Interaction via Location Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09373v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mirage-1: Augmenting and Updating GUI Agent with Hierarchical Multimodal Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10387v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap, we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

To address this gap, we propose GUIRoboTron-Speech, the first end-to-end autonomous GUI agent that directly accepts speech instructions and on-device screenshots to predict actions. Confronted with the scarcity of speech-based GUI agent datasets, we initially generated high-quality speech instructions for training by leveraging a random timbre text-to-speech (TTS) model to convert existing text instructions. We then develop GUIRoboTron-Speech's capabilities through progressive grounding and planning training stages. A key contribution is a heuristic mixed-instruction training strategy designed to mitigate the modality imbalance inherent in pre-trained foundation models. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets validate the robust and superior performance of GUIRoboTron-Speech, demonstrating the significant potential and widespread applicability of speech as an effective instruction modality for driving GUI agents.

However, existing GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories, thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training, offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning. GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation. Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities, paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://penghao-wu.github.io/GUI_Reflection/</p></details> |
| **[MCPWorld: A Unified Benchmarking Testbed for API, GUI, and Hybrid Computer Use Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07672v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g., adding MCP support), with two notable advantages: (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs. (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from specific agent implementations or UI states. Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks, covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy, simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that can leverage rich external tools.

| **[WorldGUI: An Interactive Benchmark for Desktop GUI Automation from Any Starting Point](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08047v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI agents have achieved outstanding performance in GUI element grounding. However, planning remains highly challenging, especially due to the sensitivity to the initial state of the environment. Specifically, slight differences in the initial state-such as the target software not being open or the interface not being in its default state, often lead to planning errors. This issue is widespread in real application scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail to evaluate it. To address this gap, we introduce WorldGUI, a comprehensive GUI benchmark containing tasks across ten widely used desktop and web applications (e.g., PowerPoint, VSCode, Acrobat), each instantiated with diverse initial states to simulate authentic human-computer interactions. Complementing this, we propose WorldGUI-Agent, a universal framework that unifies three core modules: Planner-Critic for high-level plan refinement, Step-Check for intermediate verification, and Actor-Critic for action-level optimization to proactively detect and correct errors. Experimental evaluation shows that WorldGUI-Agent outperforms the outstanding existing model (Claude-3.5 Computer Use) by 12.4% in success rate on WorldGUI, and achieves a 31.2% overall success rate on WindowsAgentArena, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art by 11.7%. Our analysis further reveals that dynamic augmentation tasks and desktop environments pose substantial hurdles, underscoring the necessity of adaptive planning and feedback-driven execution for advancing real-world GUI automation.

This position paper identifies three key risks of GUI agents and examines how they differ from traditional GUI automation and general autonomous agents. Despite these risks, existing evaluations focus primarily on performance, leaving privacy and security assessments largely unexplored. We review current evaluation metrics for both GUI and general LLM agents and outline five key challenges in integrating human evaluators for GUI agent assessments. To address these gaps, we advocate for a human-centered evaluation framework that incorporates risk assessments, enhances user awareness through in-context consent, and embeds privacy and security considerations into GUI agent design and evaluation.</p></details> |  |

This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GUI-Actor: Coordinate-Free Visual Grounding for GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03143v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment, inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align a dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution. Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7 with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its general-purpose strengths.</p></details> |  |

CUA have made significant progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation. Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPLE: A Mobile Agent with Persistent Finite State Machines for Structured Task Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23596v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine (FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery, and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to 12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error recovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>chang...</summary><p>change to a better title</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) highlight the compelling potential to develop versatile agents to help humans finish GUI navigation tasks.

To solve these challenges, we contribute GUICourse, a suite of datasets to train visual-based GUI agents from general VLMs. First, we introduce the GUIEnv dataset to strengthen the OCR and grounding capabilities of VLMs. Then, we introduce the GUIAct and GUIChat datasets to enrich their knowledge of GUI components and interactions. Experiments demonstrate that our GUI agents have better performance on common GUI tasks than their baseline VLMs. Even the small-size GUI agent (with 3.1B parameters) can still work well on single-step and multi-step GUI tasks.

However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2) limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions, and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents (UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments.

AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing GUI-related datasets, e.g., Rico, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective, complementing the general settings of existing datasets.

These challenges are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively. The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration without manual annotation.

However, the scarcity of diverse CoaT trajectories limits the expressiveness and generalization ability of such agents. While self-training is commonly employed to address data scarcity, existing approaches either overlook the correctness of intermediate reasoning steps or depend on expensive process-level annotations to construct process reward models (PRM). To address the above problems, we propose an Iterative Preference Learning (IPL) that constructs a CoaT-tree through interative sampling, scores leaf nodes using rule-based reward, and backpropagates feedback to derive Thinking-level Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) pairs. To prevent overfitting during warm-up supervised fine-tuning, we further introduce a three-stage instruction evolution, which leverages GPT-4o to generate diverse Q\&A pairs based on real mobile UI screenshots, enhancing both generality and layout understanding. Experiments on three standard Mobile GUI-agent benchmarks demonstrate that our agent MobileIPL outperforms strong baselines, including continual pretraining models such as OS-ATLAS and UI-TARS.

However, existing GUI agents often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and interconnected nature of real-world digital environments, where tasks frequently span multiple platforms and applications while also being impacted by version updates. To address this, we introduce TransBench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and enhance the transferability of GUI agents across three key dimensions: cross-version transferability (adapting to version updates), cross-platform transferability (generalizing across platforms like iOS, Android, and Web), and cross-application transferability (handling tasks spanning functionally distinct apps). TransBench includes 15 app categories with diverse functionalities, capturing essential pages across versions and platforms to enable robust evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in grounding accuracy, showcasing the practical utility of GUI agents in dynamic, real-world environments. Our code and data will be publicly available at GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

However, existing agents primarily focus on enhancing the accuracy of individual actions and often lack effective mechanisms for detecting and recovering from errors. To address these shortcomings, we propose the BacktrackAgent, a robust framework that incorporates a backtracking mechanism to improve task completion efficiency. BacktrackAgent includes verifier, judger, and reflector components as modules for error detection and recovery, while also applying judgment rewards to further enhance the agent's performance. Additionally, we develop a training dataset specifically designed for the backtracking mechanism, which considers the outcome pages after action executions. Experimental results show that BacktrackAgent has achieved performance improvements in both task success rate and step accuracy on Mobile3M and Auto-UI benchmarks. Our data and code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GUI agents based on LLMs or vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to generalize to novel environments and rely heavily on manually curated, diverse datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ScreenExplorer, a VLM trained via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) in real, dynamic, and open-ended GUI environments. Innovatively, we introduced a world-model-based curiosity reward function to help the agent overcome the cold-start phase of exploration. Additionally, distilling experience streams further enhances the model's exploration capabilities. Our training framework enhances model exploration in open GUI environments, with trained models showing better environmental adaptation and sustained exploration compared to static deployment models. Our findings offer a scalable pathway toward AGI systems with self-improving capabilities in complex interactive settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[UI-R1: Enhancing Efficient Action Prediction of GUI Agents by Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21620v5)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent DeepSeek-R1 has showcased the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards. Despite its success in language models, its application in multi-modal domains, particularly in graphic user interface (GUI) agent tasks, remains under-explored. To address this issue, we propose UI-R1, the first framework to explore how rule-based RL can enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for GUI action prediction tasks. Specifically, UI-R1 introduces a novel rule-based action reward, enabling model optimization via policy-based algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). For efficient training, we curate a small yet high-quality dataset of 136 challenging tasks, encompassing five common action types on mobile devices. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed UI-R1-3B achieves significant improvements over the base model (i.e. Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks, with average accuracy gains of 22.1% on ScreenSpot, 6.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, and 12.7% on ANDROIDCONTROL. Furthermore, UI-R1-3B delivers competitive performance compared to larger models (e.g., OS-Atlas-7B) trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on 76K samples. We additionally develop an optimized version, UI-R1-E-3B, which significantly improves both grounding efficiency and accuracy. These results underscore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning to advance GUI understanding and control, paving the way for future research in this domain.

| **[Enhancing Visual Grounding for GUI Agents via Self-Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12370v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made substantial strides in understanding and executing user instructions across diverse platforms. Yet, grounding these instructions to precise interface elements remains challenging, especially in complex, high-resolution, professional environments. Traditional supervised finetuning (SFT) methods often require large volumes of diverse data and exhibit weak generalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework that incorporates three core strategies: (1) seed data curation to ensure high quality training samples, (2) a dense policy gradient that provides continuous feedback based on prediction accuracy, and (3) a self evolutionary reinforcement finetuning mechanism that iteratively refines the model using attention maps. With only 3k training samples, our 7B-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art results among similarly sized models on three grounding benchmarks. Notably, it attains 47.3\% accuracy on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset, outperforming much larger models, such as UI-TARS-72B, by a margin of 24.2\%. These findings underscore the effectiveness of RL-based approaches in enhancing GUI agent performance, particularly in high-resolution, complex environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProgRM: Build Better GUI Agents with Progress Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18121v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can potentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based GUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the difficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works have been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to offer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model (ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can over-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end, we propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative intermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in online training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation, we further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence) self-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign progress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and analyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and ORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for experiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

This paper systematically reviews LLM-driven phone GUI agents, highlighting their evolution from script-based automation to intelligent, adaptive systems. We first contextualize key challenges, (i) limited generality, (ii) high maintenance overhead, and (iii) weak intent comprehension, and show how LLMs address these issues through advanced language understanding, multimodal perception, and robust decision-making. We then propose a taxonomy covering fundamental agent frameworks (single-agent, multi-agent, plan-then-act), modeling approaches (prompt engineering, training-based), and essential datasets and benchmarks. Furthermore, we detail task-specific architectures, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning strategies that bridge user intent and GUI operations. Finally, we discuss open challenges such as dataset diversity, on-device deployment efficiency, user-centric adaptation, and security concerns, offering forward-looking insights into this rapidly evolving field. By providing a structured overview and identifying pressing research gaps, this paper serves as a definitive reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness LLMs in designing scalable, user-friendly phone GUI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables, Project Homepage: https://github.com/PhoneLLM/Awesome-LLM-Powered-Phone-GUI-Agents</p></details> |
| **[GEM: Gaussian Embedding Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Detection in GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12842v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have recently emerged as an intriguing paradigm for human-computer interaction, capable of automatically executing user instructions to operate intelligent terminal devices. However, when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) instructions that violate environmental constraints or exceed the current capabilities of agents, GUI agents may suffer task breakdowns or even pose security threats. Therefore, effective OOD detection for GUI agents is essential. Traditional OOD detection methods perform suboptimally in this domain due to the complex embedding space and evolving GUI environments. In this work, we observe that the in-distribution input semantic space of GUI agents exhibits a clustering pattern with respect to the distance from the centroid. Based on the finding, we propose GEM, a novel method based on fitting a Gaussian mixture model over input embedding distances extracted from the GUI Agent that reflect its capability boundary. Evaluated on eight datasets spanning smartphones, computers, and web browsers, our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.70\% over the best-performing baseline. Analysis verifies the generalization ability of our method through experiments on nine different backbones.

However, due to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers, such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic, with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%.

MLLMs suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of structured interaction triples (observation, action, outcome). This eliminates the need for human involvement in knowledge extraction. With a task success rate of 53.7% on SPA-Bench and 47.4% on AndroidWorld, GUI-explorer shows significant improvements over SOTA agents. It requires no parameter updates for new apps.

| **[GUI-G1: Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training for Visual Grounding in GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15810v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents replicate the R1-Zero paradigm, coupling online Reinforcement Learning (RL) with explicit chain-of-thought reasoning prior to object grounding and thereby achieving substantial performance gains. In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design, output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second, we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better optimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on ScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even outperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI agent grounding.

| **[ARPO:End-to-End Policy Optimization for GUI Agents with Experience Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16282v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) as interactive agents for controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a unique challenge to optimize long-horizon action sequences with multimodal feedback from complex environments. While recent works have advanced multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning and tool-using capabilities in LLMs, their application to GUI-based agents remains relatively underexplored due to the difficulty of sparse rewards, delayed feedback, and high rollout costs. In this paper, we investigate end-to-end policy optimization for vision-language-based GUI agents with the aim of improving performance on complex, long-horizon computer tasks. We propose Agentic Replay Policy Optimization (ARPO), an end-to-end RL approach that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a replay buffer to reuse the successful experience across training iterations. To further stabilize the training process, we propose a task selection strategy that filters tasks based on baseline agent performance, allowing the agent to focus on learning from informative interactions. Additionally, we compare ARPO with offline preference optimization approaches, highlighting the advantages of policy-based methods in GUI environments. Experiments on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that ARPO achieves competitive results, establishing a new performance baseline for LLM-based GUI agents trained via reinforcement learning. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for training multi-turn, vision-language GUI agents capable of managing complex real-world UI interactions.

However, a major challenge in developing generalized GUI agents is the lack of sufficient trajectory data across various operating systems and applications, mainly due to the high cost of manual annotations. In this paper, we propose the TongUI framework that builds generalized GUI agents by learning from rich multimodal web tutorials. Concretely, we crawl and process online GUI tutorials (such as videos and articles) into GUI agent trajectory data, through which we produce the GUI-Net dataset containing 143K trajectory data across five operating systems and more than 200 applications. We develop the TongUI agent by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B models on GUI-Net, which show remarkable performance improvements on commonly used grounding and navigation benchmarks, outperforming baseline agents about 10\% on multiple benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the GUI-Net dataset and underscoring the significance of our TongUI framework. We will fully open-source the code, the GUI-Net dataset, and the trained models soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVA: Red-Teaming GUI Agents via Evolving Indirect Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14289v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multimodal agents are increasingly trained to operate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete user tasks, they face a growing threat from indirect prompt injection, attacks in which misleading instructions are embedded into the agent's visual environment, such as popups or chat messages, and misinterpreted as part of the intended task. A typical example is environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response. Compared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard for how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to emerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates and far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA on six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings such as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email composition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success rates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the attacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective patterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models, revealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that evolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming agents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal decision making.</p></details> |  |

However, these agents face considerable challenges in task planning, as they must continuously analyze the GUI and generate operation instructions step by step. This process often leads to difficulties in making accurate task plans, as GUI agents lack a deep understanding of how to effectively use the target applications, which can cause them to become "lost" during task execution. To address the task planning issue, we propose SPlanner, a plug-and-play planning module to generate execution plans that guide vision language model(VLMs) in executing tasks. The proposed planning module utilizes extended finite state machines (EFSMs) to model the control logits and configurations of mobile applications. It then decomposes a user instruction into a sequence of primary function modeled in EFSMs, and generate the execution path by traversing the EFSMs. We further refine the execution path into a natural language plan using an LLM. The final plan is concise and actionable, and effectively guides VLMs to generate interactive GUI actions to accomplish user tasks. SPlanner demonstrates strong performance on dynamic benchmarks reflecting real-world mobile usage. On the AndroidWorld benchmark, SPlanner achieves a 63.8% task success rate when paired with Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the VLM executor, yielding a 28.8 percentage point improvement compared to using Qwen2.5-VL-72B without planning assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Training these agents requires large-scale high-quality data, which is prohibitively expensive when relying on human labor. Given the vast population of global mobile phone users, if automated data collection from them becomes feasible, the resulting data volume and the subsequently trained mobile agents could reach unprecedented levels. Nevertheless, two major challenges arise: (1) extracting user instructions without human intervention and (2) utilizing distributed user data while preserving privacy. To tackle these challenges, we propose MobileA3gent, a collaborative framework that trains mobile GUI Agents using decentralized self-sourced data from diverse users. The framework comprises two components, each targeting a specific challenge: (1) Auto-Annotation, which enables the automatic collection of high-quality datasets during users' routine phone usage with minimal cost. (2) FedVLM-A, which enhances federated VLM training under non-IID distributions by incorporating adapted global aggregation based on both episode-level and step-level variability. Extensive experiments prove that MobileA3gent achieves superior performance over traditional approaches at only 1% of the cost, highlighting its potential for real-world applications</p></details> |  |

This paper characterizes three UCs from three perspectives: phenomena, influence and mitigation, drawing on social media analysis (N=221 posts) and semi-structured interviews (N=14). Key phenomenon for UCs include agents' deficiencies in comprehending instructions and planning tasks, challenges in executing accurate GUI interactions and adapting to dynamic interfaces, the generation of unreliable or misaligned outputs, and shortcomings in error handling and feedback processing. These phenomena manifest as influences from unanticipated actions and user frustration, to privacy violations and security vulnerabilities, and further to eroded trust and wider ethical concerns. Our analysis also identifies user-initiated mitigation, such as technical adjustments and manual oversight, and provides implications for designing future LLM-based GUI agents that are robust, user-centric, and transparent, fostering a crucial balance between automation and human oversight.</p></details> |  |

We then review the modular architecture of (M)LLM-based GUI agents, covering Perception, Planning, and Acting modules, and trace their evolution through representative works. Furthermore, we categorize GUI agent training methodologies into Prompt-based, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)-based, and RL-based approaches, highlighting the progression from simple prompt engineering to dynamic policy learning via RL. Our summary illustrates how recent innovations in multimodal perception, decision reasoning, and adaptive action generation have significantly improved the generalization and robustness of GUI agents in complex real-world environments.

However, existing UI agents usually demand powerful large language models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, raising huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pre-trained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.

To enable this, we construct Aguvis Data Collection, a large-scale dataset with multimodal grounding and reasoning annotations, and develop a two-stage training pipeline that separates GUI grounding from planning and reasoning. Experiments show that Aguvis achieves state-of-the-art performance across offline and real-world online benchmarks, marking the first fully autonomous vision-based GUI agent that operates without closed-source models. We open-source all datasets, models, and training recipes at https://aguvis-project.github.io to advance future research.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step. Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models. Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks.

Traditional approaches using pre-training or fine-tuning with massive datasets struggle with the diversity of mobile applications and user-specific tasks. We propose enhancing mobile GUI agent capabilities through human demonstrations, focusing on improving performance in unseen scenarios rather than pursuing universal generalization through larger datasets. To realize this paradigm, we introduce LearnGUI, the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for studying demonstration-based learning in mobile GUI agents, comprising 2,252 offline tasks and 101 online tasks with high-quality human demonstrations. We further develop LearnAct, a sophisticated multi-agent framework that automatically extracts knowledge from demonstrations to enhance task completion. This framework integrates three specialized agents: DemoParser for knowledge extraction, KnowSeeker for relevant knowledge retrieval, and ActExecutor for demonstration-enhanced task execution.

However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.</p></details> |  |

Compared to approaches predicated on GUI metadata, which are platform-dependent and vulnerable to implementation variations, vision-based approaches offer broader applicability. In this vision-based paradigm, the GUI instruction grounding, which maps user instruction to the location of corresponding element on the given screenshot, remains a critical challenge, particularly due to limited public training dataset and resource-intensive manual instruction data annotation. In this paper, we delve into unexplored challenges in this task including element-to-screen ratio, unbalanced element type, and implicit instruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a large-scale data synthesis pipeline UI-E2I-Synth for generating varying complex instruction datasets using GPT-4o instead of human annotators. Furthermore, we propose a new GUI instruction grounding benchmark UI-I2E-Bench, which is designed to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse annotation aspects. Our model, trained on the synthesized data, achieves superior performance in GUI instruction grounding, demonstrating the advancements of proposed data synthesis pipeline. The proposed benchmark, accompanied by extensive analyses, provides practical insights for future research in GUI grounding. We will release corresponding artifacts at https://colmon46.github.io/i2e-bench-leaderboard/ .</p></details> |  |

An ideal GUI agent is expected to achieve high accuracy, low latency, and compatibility for different GUI platforms. Recent vision-based approaches have shown promise by leveraging advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs). While they generally meet the requirements of compatibility and low latency, these vision-based GUI agents tend to have low accuracy due to their limitations in element grounding. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{SpiritSight}$, a vision-based, end-to-end GUI agent that excels in GUI navigation tasks across various GUI platforms. First, we create a multi-level, large-scale, high-quality GUI dataset called $\textbf{GUI-Lasagne}$ using scalable methods, empowering SpiritSight with robust GUI understanding and grounding capabilities. Second, we introduce the $\textbf{Universal Block Parsing (UBP)}$ method to resolve the ambiguity problem in dynamic high-resolution of visual inputs, further enhancing SpiritSight's ability to ground GUI objects. Through these efforts, SpiritSight agent outperforms other advanced methods on diverse GUI benchmarks, demonstrating its superior capability and compatibility in GUI navigation tasks.

However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich, reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then examine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal reasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11 mid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on WebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior assumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets, resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on AndroidWorld. Our work provides valuable insights into cross-domain knowledge transfer for GUI agents and offers a practical approach to addressing data scarcity challenges in this emerging field. The code, data and models will be available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/GUIMid.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |
| **[The Obvious Invisible Threat: LLM-Powered GUI Agents' Vulnerability to Fine-Print Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11281v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Large Language Model (LLM) powered GUI agent is a specialized autonomous system that performs tasks on the user's behalf according to high-level instructions. It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary sequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions such as clicking, typing, and tapping. To complete real-world tasks, such as filling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on sensitive user data. However, this autonomy introduces new privacy and security risks. Adversaries can inject malicious content into the GUIs that alters agent behaviors or induces unintended disclosures of private information. These attacks often exploit the discrepancy between visual saliency for agents and human users, or the agent's limited ability to detect violations of contextual integrity in task automation. In this paper, we characterized six types of such attacks, and conducted an experimental study to test these attacks with six state-of-the-art GUI agents, 234 adversarial webpages, and 39 human participants. Our findings suggest that GUI agents are highly vulnerable, particularly to contextually embedded threats. Moreover, human users are also susceptible to many of these attacks, indicating that simple human oversight may not reliably prevent failures. This misalignment highlights the need for privacy-aware agent design. We propose practical defense strategies to inform the development of safer and more reliable GUI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[AppAgentX: Evolving GUI Agents as Proficient Smartphone Users](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02268v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of intelligent LLM-based agents capable of interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These agents demonstrate strong reasoning and adaptability, enabling them to perform complex tasks that traditionally required predefined rules. However, the reliance on step-by-step reasoning in LLM-based agents often results in inefficiencies, particularly for routine tasks. In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility. Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts, replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in professional domains remains under-explored. These specialized workflows introduce unique challenges for GUI perception models, including high-resolution displays, smaller target sizes, and complex environments. In this paper, we introduce ScreenSpot-Pro, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the grounding capabilities of MLLMs in high-resolution professional settings. The benchmark comprises authentic high-resolution images from a variety of professional domains with expert annotations. It spans 23 applications across five industries and three operating systems. Existing GUI grounding models perform poorly on this dataset, with the best model achieving only 18.9%. Our experiments reveal that strategically reducing the search area enhances accuracy. Based on this insight, we propose ScreenSeekeR, a visual search method that utilizes the GUI knowledge of a strong planner to guide a cascaded search, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 48.1% without any additional training. We hope that our benchmark and findings will advance the development of GUI agents for professional applications.

However, users often inadvertently omit key information when conveying tasks, which hinders agent performance in the current agent paradigm that does not support immediate user intervention. To address this issue, we introduce a $\textbf{Self-Correction GUI Navigation}$ task that incorporates interactive information completion capabilities within GUI agents. We developed the $\textbf{Navi-plus}$ dataset with GUI follow-up question-answer pairs, alongside a $\textbf{Dual-Stream Trajectory Evaluation}$ method to benchmark this new capability.

However, their increasing autonomy has raised critical concerns about their security, privacy, and safety. This survey examines the trustworthiness of GUI agents in five critical dimensions: security vulnerabilities, reliability in dynamic environments, transparency and explainability, ethical considerations, and evaluation methodologies. We also identify major challenges such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, cascading failure modes in sequential decision-making, and a lack of realistic evaluation benchmarks. These issues not only hinder real-world deployment but also call for comprehensive mitigation strategies beyond task success. As GUI agents become more widespread, establishing robust safety standards and responsible development practices is essential.

Building on this foundation, we introduce ScreenLLM, a set of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) tailored for advanced UI understanding and action prediction. Extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models show that ScreenLLM accurately models user behavior and predicts actions.

| **[GUI-World: A Video Benchmark and Dataset for Multimodal GUI-oriented Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10819v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been used as agents to control keyboard and mouse inputs by directly perceiving the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and generating corresponding commands. However, current agents primarily demonstrate strong understanding capabilities in static environments and are mainly applied to relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces. We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks. Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions. To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats. We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Image LLMs and Video LLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that current models struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, Video LLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Therefore, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned Video LLM, GUI-Vid, as a GUI-oriented assistant, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using video LLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding.

| **[Safeguarding Mobile GUI Agent via Logic-based Action Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18492v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have unlocked new possibilities in human-computer interaction, particularly with the rise of mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents capable of interpreting GUIs. These agents promise to revolutionize mobile computing by allowing users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions. However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors. To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. VSA is designed to deterministically ensure that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before conducting an action. At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification, expressed in our domain-specific language (DSL). This enables runtime, rule-based verification, allowing VSA to detect and prevent erroneous actions executing an action, either by providing corrective feedback or halting unsafe behavior. To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agent. effectively bridging the gap between LFM-driven automation and formal software verification. We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LLM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps. The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.3%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, representing a significant 20.4%-25.6% improvement over existing LLM-based verification methods, and consequently increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods face challenges in generalizing across applications (apps) and tasks, primarily due to two fundamental limitations in existing datasets. First, these datasets overlook developer-induced structural variations among apps, limiting the transferability of knowledge across diverse software environments. Second, many of them focus solely on navigation tasks, which restricts their capacity to represent comprehensive software architectures and complex user interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Xplore, a dataset meticulously designed to enhance cross-application and cross-task generalization via an exploration-and-reasoning framework. GUI-Xplore integrates pre-recorded exploration videos providing contextual insights, alongside five hierarchically structured downstream tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate GUI agent capabilities. To fully exploit GUI-Xplore's unique features, we propose Xplore-Agent, a GUI agent framework that combines Action-aware GUI Modeling with Graph-Guided Environment Reasoning. Further experiments indicate that Xplore-Agent achieves a 10% improvement over existing methods in unfamiliar environments, yet there remains significant potential for further enhancement towards truly generalizable GUI agents.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Unlike previous mobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to directly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to evaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel paradigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing verifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction coupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification process, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance the verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint annotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale. V-Droid sets a new state-of-the-art task success rate across several public mobile task automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49% on MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 9.5%, 2.1%, and 9%, respectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves an impressively low latency of 0.7 seconds per step, making it the first mobile agent capable of delivering near-real-time, effective decision-making capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 iterations, refine figs</p></details> |

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16788v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning capabilities have significantly improved the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) in domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding, and visual question-answering. However, their impact on real-world applications remains unclear. This paper presents the first empirical study on the effectiveness of reasoning-enabled VLMs in mobile GUI agents, a domain that requires interpreting complex screen layouts, understanding user instructions, and executing multi-turn interactions. We evaluate two pairs of commercial models--Gemini 2.0 Flash and Claude 3.7 Sonnet--comparing their base and reasoning-enhanced versions across two static benchmarks (ScreenSpot and AndroidControl) and one interactive environment (AndroidWorld). We surprisingly find the Claude 3.7 Sonnet reasoning model achieves state-of-the-art performance on AndroidWorld. However, reasoning VLMs generally offer marginal improvements over non-reasoning models on static benchmarks and even degrade performance in some agent setups. Notably, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs fail on different sets of tasks, suggesting that reasoning does have an impact, but its benefits and drawbacks counterbalance each other. We attribute these inconsistencies to the limitations of benchmarks and VLMs. Based on the findings, we provide insights for further enhancing mobile GUI agents in terms of benchmarks, VLMs, and their adaptability in dynamically invoking reasoning VLMs. The experimental data are publicly available at https://github.com/LlamaTouch/VLM-Reasoning-Traces.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose an automated GUI data generation pipeline, AutoCaptioner, which generates data with rich descriptions while minimizing human effort. Using AutoCaptioner, we created a novel large-scale desktop GUI dataset, DeskVision, along with the largest desktop test benchmark, DeskVision-Eval, which reflects daily usage and covers diverse systems and UI elements, each with rich descriptions. With DeskVision, we train a new GUI understanding model, GUIExplorer. Results show that GUIExplorer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in understanding/grounding visual elements without the need for complex architectural designs. We further validated the effectiveness of the DeskVision dataset through ablation studies on various large visual language models (LVLMs).

However, in resource-constrained scenarios, the format discrepancy between coordinate-oriented grounding and action-oriented reasoning limits the effectiveness of grounding for reasoning tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a query-oriented pivot approach called query inference, which serves as a bridge between GUI grounding and reasoning. By inferring potential user queries from a screenshot and its associated element coordinates, query inference improves the understanding of coordinates while aligning more closely with reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that query inference outperforms previous grounding techniques under the same training data scale. Notably, query inference achieves comparable or even better performance to large-scale grounding-enhanced OS-Atlas with less than 0.1% of training data. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reasoning formats and demonstrate that integrating additional semantic information into the input further boosts reasoning performance.

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

We propose an environment-free RL framework that decouples value estimation from policy optimization by leveraging a pretrained Value Environment Model (VEM). VEM predicts state-action values directly from offline data, distilling human-like priors about GUI interaction outcomes without requiring next-state prediction or environmental feedback. This avoids compounding errors and enhances resilience to UI changes by focusing on semantic reasoning (e.g., Does this action advance the user's goal?). The framework operates in two stages: (1) pretraining VEM to estimate long-term action utilities and (2) guiding policy exploration with frozen VEM signals, enabling layout-agnostic GUI automation. Evaluated on Android-in-the-Wild benchmarks, VEM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both offline and online settings, outperforming environment-free baselines significantly and matching environment-based approaches without interaction costs. Importantly, VEM demonstrates that semantic-aware value estimation can achieve comparable performance with online-trained methods.</p></details> | 20pages,5 figures |

To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical agent framework named PC-Agent. Specifically, from the perception perspective, we devise an Active Perception Module (APM) to overcome the inadequate abilities of current MLLMs in perceiving screenshot content. From the decision-making perspective, to handle complex user instructions and interdependent subtasks more effectively, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration architecture that decomposes decision-making processes into Instruction-Subtask-Action levels. Within this architecture, three agents (i.e., Manager, Progress and Decision) are set up for instruction decomposition, progress tracking and step-by-step decision-making respectively. Additionally, a Reflection agent is adopted to enable timely bottom-up error feedback and adjustment. We also introduce a new benchmark PC-Eval with 25 real-world complex instructions. Empirical results on PC-Eval show that our PC-Agent achieves a 32% absolute improvement of task success rate over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Mobile GUI agents, a subset of AI agents, are designed to autonomously perform tasks on mobile devices. While numerous studies have introduced agents, datasets, and benchmarks to advance mobile GUI agent research, many existing datasets focus on static frame evaluations and fail to provide a comprehensive platform for assessing performance on real-world, in-the-wild tasks. To address this gap, we present Android Agent Arena (A3), a novel evaluation platform. Unlike existing in-the-wild systems, A3 offers: (1) meaningful and practical tasks, such as real-time online information retrieval and operational instructions; (2) a larger, more flexible action space, enabling compatibility with agents trained on any dataset; and (3) automated business-level LLM-based evaluation process. A3 includes 21 widely used general third-party apps and 201 tasks representative of common user scenarios, providing a robust foundation for evaluating mobile GUI agents in real-world situations and a new autonomous evaluation process for less human labor and coding expertise.

| **[TRISHUL: Towards Region Identification and Screen Hierarchy Understanding for Large VLM based GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08226v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have enabled the development of LVLM-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents under various paradigms. Training-based approaches, such as CogAgent and SeeClick, struggle with cross-dataset and cross-platform generalization due to their reliance on dataset-specific training. Generalist LVLMs, such as GPT-4V, employ Set-of-Marks (SoM) for action grounding, but obtaining SoM labels requires metadata like HTML source, which is not consistently available across platforms. Moreover, existing methods often specialize in singular GUI tasks rather than achieving comprehensive GUI understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce TRISHUL, a novel, training-free agentic framework that enhances generalist LVLMs for holistic GUI comprehension. Unlike prior works that focus on either action grounding (mapping instructions to GUI elements) or GUI referring (describing GUI elements given a location), TRISHUL seamlessly integrates both. At its core, TRISHUL employs Hierarchical Screen Parsing (HSP) and the Spatially Enhanced Element Description (SEED) module, which work synergistically to provide multi-granular, spatially, and semantically enriched representations of GUI elements. Our results demonstrate TRISHUL's superior performance in action grounding across the ScreenSpot, VisualWebBench, AITW, and Mind2Web datasets. Additionally, for GUI referring, TRISHUL surpasses the ToL agent on the ScreenPR benchmark, setting a new standard for robust and adaptable GUI comprehension.</p></details> | 8 pages 5 figures |

| **[WinClick: GUI Grounding with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04730v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) tasks are vital for automating workflows such as software testing, user interface navigation. For users, the GUI is the most intuitive platform for interacting with a computer. Previous work identified a key challenge in developing visual GUI agents: GUI grounding - the ability to accurately locate screen elements based on instructions. However, most existing GUI agents rely on structured data formats like DOM or HTML files in training or inferencing, which are inaccessible across all applications, particular in a general desktop environments such as Windows OS. To address this, we introduce WinClick, a novel visual GUI agent developed in Windows platform. WinClick leverages screenshots to detect actionable regions. To overcome the challenge of GUI grounding, we enhance WinClick with GUI grounding pre-training and propose an LLM-based method for aligning GUI grounding data. Additionally, we introduce WinSpot, the first comprehensive benchmark for GUI grounding on Windows. Our experiments demonstrate that WinClick, combined with GUI grounding pre-training, significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable solution for GUI automation in desktop environments. WinSpot is publicly available at https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/WinSpot.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prevailing agent frameworks that depend on heavily wrapped commercial models (e.g., GPT-4o) with expert-crafted prompts and workflows, UI-TARS is an end-to-end model that outperforms these sophisticated frameworks. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance: UI-TARS achieves SOTA performance in 10+ GUI agent benchmarks evaluating perception, grounding, and GUI task execution. Notably, in the OSWorld benchmark, UI-TARS achieves scores of 24.6 with 50 steps and 22.7 with 15 steps, outperforming Claude (22.0 and 14.9 respectively). In AndroidWorld, UI-TARS achieves 46.6, surpassing GPT-4o (34.5). UI-TARS incorporates several key innovations: (1) Enhanced Perception: leveraging a large-scale dataset of GUI screenshots for context-aware understanding of UI elements and precise captioning; (2) Unified Action Modeling, which standardizes actions into a unified space across platforms and achieves precise grounding and interaction through large-scale action traces; (3) System-2 Reasoning, which incorporates deliberate reasoning into multi-step decision making, involving multiple reasoning patterns such as task decomposition, reflection thinking, milestone recognition, etc. (4) Iterative Training with Reflective Online Traces, which addresses the data bottleneck by automatically collecting, filtering, and reflectively refining new interaction traces on hundreds of virtual machines. Through iterative training and reflection tuning, UI-TARS continuously learns from its mistakes and adapts to unforeseen situations with minimal human intervention. We also analyze the evolution path of GUI agents to guide the further development of this domain.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can assist people in tasks like writing emails, but struggle to understand and interact with GUIs, thus limiting their potential to increase automation levels. In this paper, we introduce CogAgent, an 18-billion-parameter visual language model (VLM) specializing in GUI understanding and navigation. By utilizing both low-resolution and high-resolution image encoders, CogAgent supports input at a resolution of 1120*1120, enabling it to recognize tiny page elements and text. As a generalist visual language model, CogAgent achieves the state of the art on five text-rich and four general VQA benchmarks, including VQAv2, OK-VQA, Text-VQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, infoVQA, DocVQA, MM-Vet, and POPE. CogAgent, using only screenshots as input, outperforms LLM-based methods that consume extracted HTML text on both PC and Android GUI navigation tasks -- Mind2Web and AITW, advancing the state of the art.

However, current research focuses on GUI task automation, limiting the scope of applications in various GUI scenarios. In this paper, we propose a formalized and comprehensive environment to evaluate the entire process of automated GUI Testing (GTArena), offering a fair, standardized environment for consistent operation of diverse multimodal large language models. We divide the testing process into three key subtasks: test intention generation, test task execution, and GUI defect detection, and construct a benchmark dataset based on these to conduct a comprehensive evaluation. It evaluates the performance of different models using three data types: real mobile applications, mobile applications with artificially injected defects, and synthetic data, thoroughly assessing their capabilities in this relevant task. Additionally, we propose a method that helps researchers explore the correlation between the performance of multimodal language large models in specific scenarios and their general capabilities in standard benchmark tests. Experimental results indicate that even the most advanced models struggle to perform well across all sub-tasks of automated GUI Testing, highlighting a significant gap between the current capabilities of Autonomous GUI Testing and its practical, real-world applicability. This gap provides guidance for the future direction of GUI Agent development. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZJU-ACES-ISE/ChatUITest.</p></details> |  |

| **[Falcon-UI: Understanding GUI Before Following User Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09362v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pursuing human-like interaction for Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents requires understanding the GUI context and following user instructions. However, existing works typically couple these two aspects and focus more on instruct-following abilities, while ignoring the importance of understanding the GUI context. In this paper, we introduce an instruction-free GUI navigation dataset, termed Insight-UI Dataset, to enhance model comprehension of GUI environments. Insight-UI Dataset is automatically generated from the Common Crawl corpus, simulating various platforms -- including iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux -- across multiple resolutions on 312K domains. Although GUI interactions vary by context, diverse interfaces share common internal patterns, such as clicking an item to view its details. It implies the feasibility of independent GUI operation learning, followed by joint optimization with instruction tuning. Thereby, we develop the GUI agent model Falcon-UI, which is initially pretrained on Insight-UI Dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on Android and Web GUI datasets, including AITW, AITZ, Android Control, and Mind2Web. With 7 billion parameters, Falcon-UI achieves accuracy comparable to the 72 billion-parameter Qwen2VL on AITZ, validating the alignment between GUI context comprehension and agent performance. Our code and dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |
| **[MobileFlow: A Multimodal LLM For Mobile GUI Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04346v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, the integration of mobile Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) is ubiquitous in most people's daily lives. And the ongoing evolution of multimodal large-scale models, such as GPT-4v, Qwen-VL-Max, has significantly bolstered the capabilities of GUI comprehension and user action analysis, showcasing the potentiality of intelligent GUI assistants. However, current GUI Agents often need to access page layout information through calling system APIs, which may pose privacy risks. Fixing GUI (such as mobile interfaces) to a certain low resolution might result in the loss of fine-grained image details. At the same time, the multimodal large models built for GUI Agents currently have poor understanding and decision-making abilities for Chinese GUI interfaces, making them difficult to apply to a large number of Chinese apps. This paper introduces MobileFlow, a multimodal large language model meticulously crafted for mobile GUI agents. Transforming from the open-source model Qwen-VL-Chat into GUI domain, MobileFlow contains approximately 21 billion parameters and is equipped with novel hybrid visual encoders, making it possible for variable resolutions of image inputs and good support for multilingual GUI. By incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoE) expansions and pioneering alignment training strategies, MobileFlow has the capacity to fully interpret image data and comprehend user instructions for GUI interaction tasks. Finally, MobileFlow outperforms Qwen-VL-Max and GPT-4v in terms of task execution by GUI agents on both public and our proposed evaluation metrics, and has been successfully deployed in real-world business contexts, proving its effectiveness for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ponder & Press: Advancing Visual GUI Agent towards General Computer Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01268v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing GUI agents typically depend on non-vision inputs like HTML source code or accessibility trees, limiting their flexibility across diverse software environments and platforms. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which excel at using vision to ground real-world objects, offer a potential alternative. However, they often struggle with accurately localizing GUI elements -- a critical requirement for effective GUI automation -- due to the semantic gap between real-world objects and GUI elements. In this work, we introduce Ponder & Press, a divide-and-conquer framework for general computer control using only visual input. Our approach combines an general-purpose MLLM as an 'interpreter', responsible for translating high-level user instructions into detailed action descriptions, with a GUI-specific MLLM as a 'locator' that precisely locates GUI elements for action placement. By leveraging a purely visual input, our agent offers a versatile, human-like interaction paradigm applicable to a wide range of applications. Ponder & Press locator outperforms existing models by +22.5% on the ScreenSpot GUI grounding benchmark. Both offline and interactive agent benchmarks across various GUI environments -- including web pages, desktop software, and mobile UIs -- demonstrate that Ponder & Press framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the potential of visual GUI agents.

As an early beta, its capability in the real-world complex environment remains unknown. In this case study to explore Claude 3.5 Computer Use, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed tasks spanning a variety of domains and software. Observations from these cases demonstrate Claude 3.5 Computer Use's unprecedented ability in end-to-end language to desktop actions. Along with this study, we provide an out-of-the-box agent framework for deploying API-based GUI automation models with easy implementation. Our case studies aim to showcase a groundwork of capabilities and limitations of Claude 3.5 Computer Use with detailed analyses and bring to the fore questions about planning, action, and critic, which must be considered for future improvement.

Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.</p></details> |  |

Agent S aims to address three key challenges in automating computer tasks: acquiring domain-specific knowledge, planning over long task horizons, and handling dynamic, non-uniform interfaces. To this end, Agent S introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning, which learns from external knowledge search and internal experience retrieval at multiple levels, facilitating efficient task planning and subtask execution. In addition, it employs an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to better elicit the reasoning and control capabilities of GUI agents based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark shows that Agent S outperforms the baseline by 9.37% on success rate (an 83.6% relative improvement) and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Comprehensive analysis highlights the effectiveness of individual components and provides insights for future improvements.

However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.</p></details> |  |

Even though the task highly relies on past actions and visual observations, existing studies typically consider little semantic information carried out by intermediate screenshots and screen operations. To address this, this work presents Chain-of-Action-Thought (dubbed CoAT), which takes the description of the previous actions, the current screen, and more importantly the action thinking of what actions should be performed and the outcomes led by the chosen action. We demonstrate that, in a zero-shot setting upon three off-the-shelf LMMs, CoAT significantly improves the action prediction compared to previous proposed context modeling. To further facilitate the research in this line, we construct a dataset Android-In-The-Zoo (AitZ), which contains 18,643 screen-action pairs together with chain-of-action-thought annotations. Experiments show that fine-tuning a 1B model (i.e. AUTO-UI-base) on our AitZ dataset achieves on-par performance with CogAgent-Chat-18B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset could be found in https://github.com/IMNearth/CoAT</p></details> |

| **[Understanding Reasoning in Thinking Language Models via Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18167v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning-Finetuning Repurposes Latent Representations in Base Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12638v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backtracking, an emergent behavior elicited by reasoning fine-tuning, has been shown to be a key mechanism in reasoning models' enhanced capabilities. Prior work has succeeded in manipulating this behavior via steering vectors, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. In this work, we show that the emergence of backtracking in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B is in part driven by a repurposed direction already present in base model activations. Specifically, we identify a direction in base Llama-3.1-8B's residual stream which systematically induces backtracking when used to steer the distilled reasoning model, and find that the effects of steering with this direction cannot be trivially explained by token-level attributes. We further find that this direction does not induce backtracking in the base model, suggesting that the reasoning finetuning process repurposes pre-existing representations to form new behavioral circuits. Additionally, we hypothesize that this direction is one of several which may work together to mediate backtracking. Our findings offer a compelling picture that reasoning-finetuned models repurpose pre-existing base model representations, rather than learn new capabilities from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Simple Mechanistic Explanations for Out-Of-Context Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08218v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to their safe and reliable deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Workshop R2-FM</p></details> |

In our work, we find numerous geometric similarities across the token embeddings of large language models. First, we find ``global'' similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, we characterize local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each embedding. Both characterizations allow us to find local similarities across token embeddings. Additionally, our intrinsic dimension demonstrates that embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold, and that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Based on our findings, we introduce EMB2EMB, a simple application to linearly transform steering vectors from one language model to another, despite the two models having different dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Multiple Choice: Evaluating Steering Vectors for Adaptive Free-Form Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24859v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far, steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings, while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied. Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity, and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 21 figures, published at ICML 2025 Workshop on Reliable and Responsible Foundation Models</p></details> |

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration, making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Attribute Steering of Language Models via Targeted Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12446v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time intervention (ITI) has emerged as a promising method for steering large language model (LLM) behavior in a particular direction (e.g., improving helpfulness) by intervening on token representations without costly updates to the LLM's parameters. However, existing ITI approaches fail to scale to multi-attribute settings with conflicts, such as enhancing helpfulness while also reducing toxicity. To address this, we introduce Multi-Attribute Targeted Steering (MAT-Steer), a novel steering framework designed for selective token-level intervention across multiple attributes. MAT-Steer learns steering vectors using an alignment objective that shifts the model's internal representations of undesirable outputs closer to those of desirable ones while enforcing sparsity and orthogonality among vectors for different attributes, thereby reducing inter-attribute conflicts. We evaluate MAT-Steer in two distinct settings: (i) on question answering (QA) tasks where we balance attributes like truthfulness, bias, and toxicity; (ii) on generative tasks where we simultaneously improve attributes like helpfulness, correctness, and coherence. MAT-Steer outperforms existing ITI and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches across both task types (e.g., 3% average accuracy gain across QA tasks and 55.82% win rate against the best ITI baseline).</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 camera-ready, code link: https://github.com/duykhuongnguyen/MAT-Steer</p></details> |
| **[Activation Steering for Chain-of-Thought Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04742v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution, derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets, while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or cost-sensitive settings.

EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkfoiPfp5rQ for a quick introduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

Existing prompt-based debiasing methods exhibit instability due to their sensitivity to prompt changes, while fine-tuning-based techniques incur substantial computational overhead and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose FairSteer, a novel inference-time debiasing framework without requiring customized prompt design or model retraining. Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, our preliminary investigation demonstrates that fairness-related features can be encoded into separable directions in the hidden activation space. FairSteer operates in three steps: biased activation detection, debiasing steering vector (DSV) computation, and dynamic activation steering. Specifically, it first trains a lightweight linear classifier to detect bias signatures in activations, and then computes DSVs as intervention directions derived from small contrastive prompt pairs. Subsequently, it performs debiasing by adjusting activations with DSVs in the inference stage. Comprehensive evaluation with six LLMs demonstrates the superiority of FairSteer across question-answering, counterfactual input evaluation and open-ended text generation tasks. Code will be released.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Controlling Thinking Speed in Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03704v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System 1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3% accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.</p></details> |  |

This letter proposes a spherical-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (S-SOMP) based scheme tailored for near-field 3D channel estimation in UCA-equipped XL-MIMO systems. We establish a sparse channel representation based on the near-field spherical wave model. Then, a novel spherical-domain transform matrix codebook is designed via joint discrete sampling of distance, azimuth, and elevation parameters, leveraging analytical approximations to ensure low correlation between steering vectors. This structured codebook enables accurate sparse signal recovery using the S-SOMP algorithm for efficient joint estimation of channel path gains, spatial angles, and distances. Simulation results demonstrate significant channel estimation accuracy improvements compared to existing benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE WCL</p></details> |

Unlike conventional rigid arrays, an FIM consists of low-cost radiating elements that can independently adjust their positions and radiation characteristics, thereby allowing for real-time optimization of the sensing environment. This paper investigates the impact of FIM on wireless sensing performance. Specifically, we focus on the maximization of the cumulated power of the probing signals at the target locations under the per-antenna power constraint by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the surface shape of the transmitting FIM. We propose a block coordinate descend (BCD) algorithm to find a locally optimal solution, by alternatively updating the FIM surface shape and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other one fixed at each step. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that FIM enhances wireless sensing by providing a new design degree-of-freedom to coordinate the correlation between steering vectors at different angles. Numerical results demonstrate that FIM significantly improves wireless sensing performance under the considered multi-target scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

We apply this technique to transfer the weights of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) between models of different sizes to compare their representations. We find that small and large models learn similar representation spaces, which motivates training expensive components like SAEs on a smaller model and transferring to a larger model at a FLOPs savings. In particular, using a small-to-large transferred SAE as initialization can lead to 50% cheaper training runs when training SAEs on larger models. Next, we show that transferred probes and steering vectors can effectively recover ground truth performance. Finally, we dive deeper into feature-level transferability, finding that semantic and structural features transfer noticeably differently while specific classes of functional features have their roles faithfully mapped. Overall, our findings illustrate similarities and differences in the linear representation spaces of small and large models and demonstrate a method for improving the training efficiency of SAEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Conceptual Bias via Transformer Latent-Subspace Activation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18887v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models (LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed: per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for concept-level control for practical agentic systems.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), Sep 2025, Palermo, Italy</p></details> |
| **[No Training Wheels: Steering Vectors for Bias Correction at Inference Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18598v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations. These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap, training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap, inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fractional Reasoning via Latent Steering Vectors Improves Inference Time Compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15882v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time compute has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs), where generating multiple outputs or refining individual chains can significantly boost answer accuracy. However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, Project website: https://shengliu66.github.io/fractreason/</p></details> |

However, the practical applications of representation universality remain largely unexplored. We bridge this gap by demonstrating that safety interventions can be transferred between models through learned mappings of their shared activation spaces. We demonstrate this approach on two well-established AI safety tasks: backdoor removal and refusal of harmful prompts, showing successful transfer of steering vectors that alter the models' outputs in a predictable way. Additionally, we propose a new task, \textit{corrupted capabilities}, where models are fine-tuned to embed knowledge tied to a backdoor. This tests their ability to separate useful skills from backdoors, reflecting real-world challenges. Extensive experiments across Llama, Qwen and Gemma model families show that our method enables using smaller models to efficiently align larger ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that autoencoder mappings between base and fine-tuned models can serve as reliable ``lightweight safety switches", allowing dynamic toggling between model behaviors.</p></details> | 75 pages |

Current AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) can provide feedback that makes people feel heard. Yet it remains unclear whether LLMs represent emotion in language as humans do, or whether and how the emotional tone of their output can be controlled. We assess human-AI emotional alignment across linguistic-cultural groups and model-families, using interpretable LLM features translated from concept-sets for over twenty nuanced emotion categories (including six basic emotions). Our analyses reveal that LLM-derived emotion spaces are structurally congruent with human perception, underpinned by the fundamental affective dimensions of valence and arousal. Furthermore, these emotion-related features also accurately predict large-scale behavioural data on word ratings along these two core dimensions, reflecting both universal and language-specific patterns. Finally, by leveraging steering vectors derived solely from human-centric emotion concepts, we show that model expressions can be stably and naturally modulated across distinct emotion categories, which provides causal evidence that human emotion concepts can be used to systematically induce LLMs to produce corresponding affective states when conveying content. These findings suggest AI not only shares emotional representations with humans but its affective outputs can be precisely guided using psychologically grounded emotion concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving LLM Reasoning through Interpretable Role-Playing Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07335v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Role-playing has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods primarily rely on prompt engineering, which often lacks stability and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder Role-Playing Steering (SRPS), a novel framework that identifies and manipulates internal model features associated with role-playing behavior. Our approach extracts latent representations from role-play prompts, selects the most relevant features based on activation patterns, and constructs a steering vector that can be injected into the model's residual stream with controllable intensity. Our method enables fine-grained control over role-specific behavior and offers insights into how role information influences internal model activations. Extensive experiments across various reasoning benchmarks and model sizes demonstrate consistent performance gains. Notably, in the zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) setting, the accuracy of Llama3.1-8B on CSQA improves from 31.86% to 39.80%, while Gemma2-9B on SVAMP increases from 37.50% to 45.10%. These results highlight the potential of SRPS to enhance reasoning ability in LLMs, providing better interpretability and stability compared to traditional prompt-based role-playing.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[AlphaSteer: Learning Refusal Steering with Principled Null-Space Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07022v1)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints. For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at https://github.com/AlphaLab-USTC/AlphaSteer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Representation Transferability Hypothesis: Leveraging Small Models to Steer Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00653v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperSteer: Activation Steering at Scale with Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03292v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering language models (LMs) by modifying internal activations is a popular approach for controlling text generation. Unsupervised dictionary learning methods, e.g., sparse autoencoders, can be scaled to produce many steering vectors, but lack guarantees on the individual efficacy of each vector and control over the coverage of relevant steering tasks. In contrast, supervised methods for constructing steering vectors are targeted and effective, but require more data collection and training for each additional steering vector produced. In this work, we introduce HyperSteer, a family of hypernetwork-based architectures which are trained end-to-end to generate steering vectors conditioned on the natural language steering prompts and the internals of the steered LM. In our evaluations, we show that scaling HyperSteer with thousands of steering prompts exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art activation steering methods, even on steering prompts never seen during training. Moreover, HyperSteer performs on par with steering-via-prompting.</p></details> |  |

Steering vectors allow users to modify activations at inference time to amplify or weaken a 'concept', e.g. honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or fine-tuning. Dialz supports a diverse set of tasks, including creating contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe and controllable language generation. Dialz enables faster research cycles and facilitates insights into model interpretability, paving the way for safer, more transparent, and more reliable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL System Demo 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data. Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44% on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2 and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost. Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100 with ViT-B/32.</p></details> |  |

| **[Understanding and Mitigating Overrefusal in LLMs from an Unveiling Perspective of Safety Decision Boundary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18325v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet they often refuse to answer legitimate queries-a phenomenon known as overrefusal. Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages.

| **[Understanding (Un)Reliability of Steering Vectors in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22637v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors are a lightweight method to control language model behavior by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although steering demonstrates promising performance, recent work shows that it can be unreliable or even counterproductive in some cases. This paper studies the influence of prompt types and the geometry of activation differences on steering reliability. First, we find that all seven prompt types used in our experiments produce a net positive steering effect, but exhibit high variance across samples, and often give an effect opposite of the desired one. No prompt type clearly outperforms the others, and yet the steering vectors resulting from the different prompt types often differ directionally (as measured by cosine similarity). Second, we show that higher cosine similarity between training set activation differences predicts more effective steering. Finally, we observe that datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated are more steerable. Our results suggest that vector steering is unreliable when the target behavior is not represented by a coherent direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the activations of LLMs into a sparse linear combination of SAE features. We introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language generated by LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Aatrox103/multilingual-llm-features.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |

We test this claim by training steering vectors: layer-wise biases that additively amplify selected hidden features while leaving all original weights unchanged. Experiments on four base models across the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks show that steering vectors recover, and in several cases exceed, the accuracy of fully-tuned counterparts. This result supports the view that the required reasoning skills pre-exist in the base model. Further, logit-lens analysis reveals that the trained vectors consistently boost token groups linked to structured languages and logical connectors, providing an interpretable account that aligns with the demands of quantitative reasoning tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Aiding LLM-judges with honest alternatives using steering vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17760v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent safety evaluations of Large Language Models (LLMs) show that many models exhibit dishonest behavior, such as sycophancy. However, most honesty benchmarks focus exclusively on factual knowledge or explicitly harmful behavior and rely on external judges, which are often unable to detect less obvious forms of dishonesty. In this work, we introduce a new framework, Judge Using Safety-Steered Alternatives (JUSSA), which utilizes steering vectors trained on a single sample to elicit more honest responses from models, helping LLM-judges in the detection of dishonest behavior. To test our framework, we introduce a new manipulation dataset with prompts specifically designed to elicit deceptive responses. We find that JUSSA enables LLM judges to better differentiate between dishonest and benign responses, and helps them identify subtle instances of manipulative behavior.</p></details> |  |

However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots. Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence. Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (Findings, long paper)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders (SAEs)to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations. Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace, optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment, truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods. Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 24 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Recent approaches have leveraged the latent space of LLMs for hallucination detection, but their embeddings, optimized for linguistic coherence rather than factual accuracy, often fail to clearly separate truthful and hallucinated content. To this end, we propose the Truthfulness Separator Vector (TSV), a lightweight and flexible steering vector that reshapes the LLM's representation space during inference to enhance the separation between truthful and hallucinated outputs, without altering model parameters. Our two-stage framework first trains TSV on a small set of labeled exemplars to form compact and well-separated clusters. It then augments the exemplar set with unlabeled LLM generations, employing an optimal transport-based algorithm for pseudo-labeling combined with a confidence-based filtering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSV achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data, exhibiting strong generalization across datasets and providing a practical solution for real-world LLM applications.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry). Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 92.5% of color and 74.6% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together, these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual behavior in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Feature Space Universality Across Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06981v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Universality Hypothesis in large language models (LLMs) claims that different models converge towards similar concept representations in their latent spaces. Providing evidence for this hypothesis would enable researchers to exploit universal properties, facilitating the generalization of mechanistic interpretability techniques across models. Previous works studied if LLMs learned the same features, which are internal representations that activate on specific concepts. Since comparing features across LLMs is challenging due to polysemanticity, in which LLM neurons often correspond to multiple unrelated features rather than to distinct concepts, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been employed to disentangle LLM neurons into SAE features corresponding to distinct concepts. In this paper, we introduce a new variation of the universality hypothesis called Analogous Feature Universality: we hypothesize that even if SAEs across different models learn different feature representations, the spaces spanned by SAE features are similar, such that one SAE space is similar to another SAE space under rotation-invariant transformations. Evidence for this hypothesis would imply that interpretability techniques related to latent spaces, such as steering vectors, may be transferred across models via certain transformations. To investigate this hypothesis, we first pair SAE features across different models via activation correlation, and then measure spatial relation similarities between paired features via representational similarity measures, which transform spaces into representations that reveal hidden relational similarities. Our experiments demonstrate high similarities for SAE feature spaces across various LLMs, providing evidence for feature space universality.</p></details> |  |

Various strategies have been proposed to mitigate these biases, but most work studies biases in LLMs as a black-box problem without considering how concepts are represented within the model. We adapt techniques from representation engineering to study how the concept of "gender" is represented within LLMs. We introduce a new method that extracts concept representations via probability weighting without labeled data and efficiently selects a steering vector for measuring and manipulating the model's representation. We also present a projection-based method that enables precise steering of model predictions and demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating gender bias in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hannahxchen/gender-bias-steering</p></details> |  |

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), however, do not currently enjoy the same suite of techniques, due in part to their recency and architectural diversity. Inspired by this gap, we investigate whether MLLMs can be steered using vectors derived from their text-only LLM backbone, via sparse autoencoders (SAEs), mean shift, and linear probing. We find that text-derived steering consistently enhances multimodal accuracy across diverse MLLM architectures and visual tasks. In particular, mean shift boosts spatial relationship accuracy on CV-Bench by up to +7.3% and counting accuracy by up to +3.3%, outperforming prompting and exhibiting strong generalization to out-of-distribution datasets. These results highlight textual steering vectors as a powerful, efficient mechanism for enhancing grounding in MLLMs with minimal additional data collection and computational overhead.</p></details> |  |

Prior research has shown that a single LLM's concept representations can be captured as steering vectors (SVs), enabling the control of LLM behavior (e.g., towards generating harmful content). Our work takes a novel approach by exploring the intricate relationships between concept representations across different LLMs, drawing an intriguing parallel to Plato's Allegory of the Cave. In particular, we introduce a linear transformation method to bridge these representations and present three key findings: 1) Concept representations across different LLMs can be effectively aligned using simple linear transformations, enabling efficient cross-model transfer and behavioral control via SVs. 2) This linear transformation generalizes across concepts, facilitating alignment and control of SVs representing different concepts across LLMs. 3) A weak-to-strong transferability exists between LLM concept representations, whereby SVs extracted from smaller LLMs can effectively control the behavior of larger LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Camera Ready</p></details> |

Activation steering offers a promising method to control the generation process of LLMs by modifying their internal activations. However, existing methods commonly intervene in the model's behaviour using steering vectors generated by the model itself, which constrains their effectiveness to that specific model and excludes the possibility of leveraging powerful external expert models for steering. To address these limitations, we propose ExpertSteer, a novel approach that leverages arbitrary specialized expert models to generate steering vectors, enabling intervention in any LLMs. ExpertSteer transfers the knowledge from an expert model to a target LLM through a cohesive four-step process: first aligning representation dimensions with auto-encoders to enable cross-model transfer, then identifying intervention layer pairs based on mutual information analysis, next generating steering vectors from the expert model using Recursive Feature Machines, and finally applying these vectors on the identified layers during inference to selectively guide the target LLM without updating model parameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments using three LLMs on 15 popular benchmarks across four distinct domains. Experiments demonstrate that ExpertSteer significantly outperforms established baselines across diverse tasks at minimal cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Risk Preferences in Large Language Models by Aligning Behavioral and Neural Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11615v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Changing the behavior of large language models (LLMs) can be as straightforward as editing the Transformer's residual streams using appropriately constructed "steering vectors." These modifications to internal neural activations, a form of representation engineering, offer an effective and targeted means of influencing model behavior without retraining or fine-tuning the model. But how can such steering vectors be systematically identified? We propose a principled approach for uncovering steering vectors by aligning latent representations elicited through behavioral methods (specifically, Markov chain Monte Carlo with LLMs) with their neural counterparts. To evaluate this approach, we focus on extracting latent risk preferences from LLMs and steering their risk-related outputs using the aligned representations as steering vectors. We show that the resulting steering vectors successfully and reliably modulate LLM outputs in line with the targeted behavior.</p></details> |  |

This capability enables beam sweeping with fine angular resolution, but results in large codebook sizes that can span more than six orders of magnitude. On the other hand, the mobility of user terminals and their randomly changing orientations require constantly adjusting the beam direction. A key focus of recent research has been on the design of beam sweeping codebooks that balance a trade-off between the achievable gain and the beam search time, governed by the codebook size. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which a large codebook can be reduced to fewer steering vectors while covering the entire angular space and maintaining performance close to the maximum array gain. We derive a closed-form expression for the angular coverage range of a steering vector, subject to maintaining a gain loss within \(\gamma\) dB (e.g., 2\, dB) with respect to the maximum gain achieved by an infinitely large codebook. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a large beam-steering codebooks (such as the \(1024^{16}\) set considered in our experiment) can be reduced to just a few steering vectors. This framework serves as a proof that only a few steering vectors are sufficient to achieve near-maximum gain, challenging the common belief that a large codebook with fine angular resolution is essential to fully reap the benefits of an antenna array.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors for combined steering goals that empirically outperform additively combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs. Our code is available on github.com/jorispos/conceptorsteering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the MINT workshop at NeurIPS 2024. v4: fix sign in equation 10</p></details> |

| **[SEAL: Steerable Reasoning Calibration of Large Language Models for Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07986v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1-series have demonstrated compelling capabilities for complex reasoning tasks via the extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism. However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%.

While techniques like fine-tuning can modify model behavior, they typically require extensive computational resources. Recent work has introduced a class of contrastive activation engineering (CAE) techniques as promising approaches for steering LLM outputs through targeted modifications to their internal representations. Applied at inference-time with zero cost, CAE has the potential to introduce a new paradigm of flexible, task-specific LLM behavior tuning. We analyze the performance of CAE in in-distribution, out-of-distribution settings, evaluate drawbacks, and begin to develop comprehensive guidelines for its effective deployment. We find that 1. CAE is only reliably effective when applied to in-distribution contexts. 2. Increasing the number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns at around 80 samples. 3. Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverses the behavior that is steered for. 4. Steering vectors harm the overall model perplexity. 5. Larger models are more resistant to steering-induced degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the ICLR 2025 Bi-Align, HAIC, and Building Trust workshops</p></details> |
| **[Analyzing the Generalization and Reliability of Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12404v8)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors (SVs) have been proposed as an effective approach to adjust language model behaviour at inference time by intervening on intermediate model activations. They have shown promise in terms of improving both capabilities and model alignment. However, the reliability and generalisation properties of this approach are unknown. In this work, we rigorously investigate these properties, and show that steering vectors have substantial limitations both in- and out-of-distribution. In-distribution, steerability is highly variable across different inputs. Depending on the concept, spurious biases can substantially contribute to how effective steering is for each input, presenting a challenge for the widespread use of steering vectors. Out-of-distribution, while steering vectors often generalise well, for several concepts they are brittle to reasonable changes in the prompt, resulting in them failing to generalise well. Overall, our findings show that while steering can work well in the right circumstances, there remain technical difficulties of applying steering vectors to guide models' behaviour at scale.

In this paper, we propose a framework to assess the limitations of steering vectors as alignment mechanisms. Using a framework of transformer hook interventions and antonym-based function vectors, we evaluate the role of prompt structure and context complexity in steering effectiveness. Our findings indicate that steering vectors are promising for specific alignment tasks, such as value alignment, but may not provide a robust foundation for general-purpose alignment in LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. We establish a methodological foundation for future investigations into steering capabilities of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing, adversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often impractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this challenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively steering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks. Our key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing the direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to remove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering vectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and identify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then used to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive steering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and calibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs while strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks. Additionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against unseen attacks (i.e., structured-based attack, perturbation-based attack with project gradient descent variants, and text-only attack).

In pursuit of deeper insights and more powerful capabilities, we derive instruction-specific vector representations from language models and use them to steer models accordingly. These vectors are computed as the difference in activations between inputs with and without instructions, enabling a modular approach to activation steering. We demonstrate how this method can enhance model adherence to constraints such as output format, length, and word inclusion, providing inference-time control over instruction following. Our experiments across four models demonstrate how we can use the activation vectors to guide models to follow constraints even without explicit instructions and to enhance performance when instructions are present. Additionally, we explore the compositionality of activation steering, successfully applying multiple instructions simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that steering vectors computed on instruction-tuned models can transfer to improve base models. Our findings demonstrate that activation steering offers a practical and scalable approach for fine-grained control in language generation.

Inspired by mechanistic interpretability in language models, where direction vectors in transformer residual streams are key to model analysis and control, we investigate similar techniques in the audio domain. This paper presents the first study of latent direction vectors in large audio models and their use for continuous control of musical attributes in text-to-music generation. Focusing on binary concepts like tempo (fast vs. slow) and timbre (bright vs. dark), we compute steering vectors using the difference-in-means method on curated prompt sets. These vectors, scaled by a coefficient and injected into intermediate activations, allow fine-grained modulation of specific musical traits while preserving overall audio quality. We analyze the effect of steering strength, compare injection strategies, and identify layers with the greatest influence. Our findings highlight the promise of direction-based steering as a more mechanistic and interpretable approach to controllable music generation.</p></details> |  |

While activation steering methods, which add steering vectors to a model's hidden states, are a promising approach, existing techniques often lack precision and interpretability in how they influence model outputs. We introduce Feature Guided Activation Additions (FGAA), a novel activation steering method that leverages insights from Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and Sparse Autoencoder-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS). By operating in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and employing optimization techniques to select desired SAE features, FGAA constructs precise steering vectors that provide better steering effects while maintaining coherence of steered model outputs. In this regard, evaluations on Gemma-2-2B and Gemma-2-9B models across various steering tasks demonstrate that FGAA outperforms existing steering methods of CAA, SAE decoder steering, and SAE-TS.

TARDIS extracts steering vectors from unlabeled data and adjusts the model's representations to better align with the target time period's distribution. Our experiments reveal that TARDIS enhances downstream task performance without the need for fine-tuning, can mitigate temporal misalignment even when exact target time period data is unavailable, and remains efficient even when the temporal information of the target data points is unknown at inference time.</p></details> |  |

However, their responses are influenced by societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to undesirable differences in how the model responds when presented with images depicting people of different demographics. In this work, we propose a training-free debiasing framework for LMMs that intervenes on the model's representations during text generation by constructing a steering vector that reduces reference on protected attributes. Our framework introduces two complementary methods: (1) a dataset-based approach that constructs a steering vector by contrasting model activations on biased and neutral inputs, and (2) a novel optimization-based approach designed for low-resource settings, which constructs the steering vector using a single step of gradient-based perturbation without requiring additional data. Our experiments show that these interventions effectively reduce the propensity of LMMs to generate text related to protected attributes while maintaining sentiment and fluency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that debiased LMMs achieve comparable accuracy to their unmodified counterparts on downstream tasks, indicating that bias mitigation can be achieved without sacrificing model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 Figures, 8 Tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.13976</p></details> |

Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering) a training-free framework for controllable image generation using steering vectors to influence a diffusion model$'$s hidden representations dynamically. CASteer computes these vectors offline by averaging activations from concept-specific generated images, then applies them during inference via a dynamic heuristic that activates modifications only when necessary, removing concepts from affected images or adding them to unaffected ones. This approach enables precise control over a wide range of tasks, including removing harmful content, adding desired attributes, replacing objects, or altering styles, all without model retraining. CASteer handles both concrete and abstract concepts, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across multiple diffusion models while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects.</p></details> |  |

We employ Bayesian optimization to systematically identify effective contrastive pair datasets across nine bias axes. When optimized on the BBQ dataset, our individually tuned steering vectors achieve average improvements of 12.2%, 4.7%, and 3.2% over the baseline for Mistral, Llama, and Qwen, respectively. Building on these promising results, we introduce Steering Vector Ensembles (SVE), a method that averages multiple individually optimized steering vectors, each targeting a specific bias axis such as age, race, or gender. By leveraging their collective strength, SVE outperforms individual steering vectors in both bias reduction and maintaining model performance. The work presents the first systematic investigation of steering vectors for bias mitigation, and we demonstrate that SVE is a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for reducing bias in LLMs, with broader implications for enhancing AI safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Effectively Steer LLM To Follow Preference via Building Confident Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02989v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Having an LLM that aligns with human preferences is essential for accommodating individual needs, such as maintaining writing style or generating specific topics of interest. The majority of current alignment methods rely on fine-tuning or prompting, which can be either costly or difficult to control. Model steering algorithms, which modify the model output by constructing specific steering directions, are typically easy to implement and optimization-free. However, their capabilities are typically limited to steering the model into one of the two directions (i.e., bidirectional steering), and there has been no theoretical understanding to guarantee their performance. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to understand and quantify the model steering methods. Inspired by the framework, we propose a confident direction steering method (CONFST) that steers LLMs via modifying their activations at inference time. More specifically, CONFST builds a confident direction that is closely aligned with users' preferences, and this direction is then added to the activations of the LLMs to effectively steer the model output. Our approach offers three key advantages over popular bidirectional model steering methods: 1) It is more powerful, since multiple (i.e. more than two) users' preferences can be aligned simultaneously; 2) It is simple to implement, since there is no need to determine which layer to add the steering vector to; 3) No explicit user instruction is required. We validate our method on GPT-2 XL (1.5B), Mistral (7B) and Gemma-it (9B) models for tasks that require shifting the output of LLMs across various topics and styles, achieving superior performance over competing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[AxBench: Steering LLMs? Even Simple Baselines Outperform Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17148v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained steering of language model outputs is essential for safety and reliability. Prompting and finetuning are widely used to achieve these goals, but interpretability researchers have proposed a variety of representation-based techniques as well, including sparse autoencoders (SAEs), linear artificial tomography, supervised steering vectors, linear probes, and representation finetuning. At present, there is no benchmark for making direct comparisons between these proposals. Therefore, we introduce AxBench, a large-scale benchmark for steering and concept detection, and report experiments on Gemma-2-2B and 9B. For steering, we find that prompting outperforms all existing methods, followed by finetuning. For concept detection, representation-based methods such as difference-in-means, perform the best. On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive. We introduce a novel weakly-supervised representational method (Rank-1 Representation Finetuning; ReFT-r1), which is competitive on both tasks while providing the interpretability advantages that prompting lacks. Along with AxBench, we train and publicly release SAE-scale feature dictionaries for ReFT-r1 and DiffMean.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Activation Steering: A Tuning-Free LLM Truthfulness Improvement Method for Diverse Hallucinations Categories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00034v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have indicated that Large Language Models (LLMs) harbor an inherent understanding of truthfulness, yet often fail to consistently express it and generate false statements. This gap between "knowing" and "telling" poses a challenge for ensuring the truthfulness of generated content. Inspired by recent work on the practice of encoding human-interpretable concepts linearly within large language models, we treat truthfulness as a specially linearly encoded concept within LLMs, and introduce Adaptive Activation Steering (ACT), a tuning-free method that adaptively shifts LLM's activations in the "truthful" direction during inference. ACT addresses diverse categories of hallucinations by utilizing diverse truthfulness-related steering vectors and adjusting the steering intensity adaptively. Applied as an add-on across various models, ACT significantly improves truthfulness in LLaMA ($\uparrow$ 142%), LLaMA2 ($\uparrow$ 24%), Alpaca ($\uparrow$ 36%), Vicuna ($\uparrow$ 28%), LLaMA2-Chat ($\uparrow$ 19%), and LLaMA3($\uparrow$ 34%). Furthermore, we verify ACT's scalability across larger models (13B, 33B, 65B), underscoring the adaptability of ACT to large-scale language models.

We propose directly optimizing steering vectors through gradient descent on a single training example, and systematically investigate how these vectors generalize. We consider several steering optimization techniques, including multiple novel ones, and find that the resulting vectors effectively mediate safety-relevant behaviors in multiple models. Indeed, in experiments on an alignment-faking model, we are able to optimize one-shot steering vectors that induce harmful behavior on benign examples and whose negations suppress harmful behavior on malign examples. And in experiments on refusal suppression, we demonstrate that one-shot optimized steering vectors can transfer across inputs, yielding a Harmbench attack success rate of 96.9%. Furthermore, to quantitatively assess steering effectiveness in instruction-tuned models, we develop a novel evaluation framework using sequence probabilities from the corresponding base model. With this framework, we analyze how steering vectors modulate an instruction-tuned LLM's ability to recover from outputting false information, and find that this ability derives from the base model. Overall, our findings suggest that optimizing steering vectors on a single example can mediate misaligned behavior in LLMs, and provide a path toward better understanding the relationship between LLM behavior and activation space structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Semantics-Adaptive Activation Intervention for LLMs via Dynamic Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12299v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many tasks, yet aligning them with desired behaviors remains challenging. Activation intervention has emerged as an effective and economical method to modify the behavior of LLMs. Despite considerable interest in this area, current intervention methods exclusively employ a fixed steering vector to modify model activations, lacking adaptability to diverse input semantics. To address this limitation, we propose Semantics-Adaptive Dynamic Intervention (SADI), a novel method that constructs a dynamic steering vector to intervene model activations at inference time. More specifically, SADI utilizes activation differences in contrastive pairs to precisely identify critical elements of an LLM (i.e., attention heads, hidden states, and neurons) for targeted intervention. During inference, SADI dynamically steers model behavior by scaling element-wise activations based on the directions of input semantics. Experimental results show that SADI outperforms established baselines by substantial margins, improving task performance without training. SADI's cost-effectiveness and generalizability across various LLM backbones and tasks highlight its potential as a versatile alignment technique.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Flexible Framework for Linear Representation Hypothesis Using Maximum Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16385v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of LLMs. Park et al. (2024) formalize this notion by unifying multiple interpretations of linear representation, such as 1-dimensional subspace representation and interventions, using a causal inner product. However, their framework relies on single-token counterfactual pairs and cannot handle ambiguous contrasting pairs, limiting its applicability to complex or context-dependent concepts. We introduce a new notion of binary concepts as unit vectors in a canonical representation space, and utilize LLMs' (neural) activation differences along with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to compute concept directions (i.e., steering vectors). Our method, Sum of Activation-base Normalized Difference (SAND), formalizes the use of activation differences modeled as samples from a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, providing a principled approach to derive concept directions. We extend the applicability of Park et al. (2024) by eliminating the dependency on unembedding representations and single-token pairs. Through experiments with LLaMA models across diverse concepts and benchmarks, we demonstrate that our lightweight approach offers greater flexibility, superior performance in activation engineering tasks like monitoring and manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Multilingual LLMs Think In English?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15603v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have multilingual capabilities and can solve tasks across various languages. However, we show that current LLMs make key decisions in a representation space closest to English, regardless of their input and output languages. Exploring the internal representations with a logit lens for sentences in French, German, Dutch, and Mandarin, we show that the LLM first emits representations close to English for semantically-loaded words before translating them into the target language. We further show that activation steering in these LLMs is more effective when the steering vectors are computed in English rather than in the language of the inputs and outputs. This suggests that multilingual LLMs perform key reasoning steps in a representation that is heavily shaped by English in a way that is not transparent to system users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper 9 pages; including appendix 48 pages</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Beamforming with Widely-spaced-array for Multi-user Cross-Near-and-Far-Field Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04682v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With multi-GHz bandwidth, Terahertz (THz) beamforming has drawn increasing attention in the sixth generation (6G) and beyond communications. Existing beamforming designs mainly focus on a compact antenna array where typical communication occurs in the far-field. However, in dense multi-user scenarios, only relying on far-field angle domain fails to distinguish users at similar angles. Therefore, a multi-user widely-spaced array (MU-WSA) is exploited in this paper, which enlarges the near-field region to introduce the additional distance domain, leading to a new paradigm of cross-near-and-far-field (CNFF) communication. Under this paradigm, the CNFF channel model is investigated, based on which the subarray spacing $d_s$ and the number of subarrays $K$ in MU-WSA are optimized to maximize the channel capacity. Then, in sub-connected systems, an alternating optimization (AO) beamforming algorithm is proposed to deal with the special block-diagonal format of the analog precoder. For fully-connected systems, a low-complexity steering-vector reconstruction (SVR)-based algorithm is proposed by constructing specialized steering vectors of MU-WSA. Numerical evaluations show that due to distance domain resolutions, the MU-WSA can improve the SE by over $60$% at a power of $20$dBm compared to the compact array. Additionally, the proposed AO algorithm in the SC system can achieve over 80% of the sum (SE) of the FC system while reducing the number of phase shifters by $K^2$, thereby lowering power consumption. The SVR algorithm in the FC system can achieve over 95% of the upper bound of SE but takes only 10% of the running time of the singular vector decomposition (SVD)-based algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Understanding and Evaluation of Steering Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02716v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering methods provide a practical approach to controlling large language models by applying steering vectors to intermediate activations, guiding outputs toward desired behaviors while avoiding retraining. Despite their growing importance, the field lacks a unified understanding and consistent evaluation across tasks and datasets, hindering progress. This paper introduces a unified framework for analyzing and evaluating steering methods, formalizing their core principles and offering theoretical insights into their effectiveness. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations on multiple-choice and open-ended text generation tasks, we validate these insights, identifying key factors that influence performance and demonstrating the superiority of certain methods. Our work bridges theoretical and practical perspectives, offering actionable guidance for advancing the design, optimization, and deployment of steering methods in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRESSing Up LLM: Efficient Stylized Question-Answering via Style Subspace Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14371v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DRESS, a novel approach for generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses through representation editing. Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents.

| **[Movable Antenna Enhanced Integrated Sensing and Communication Via Antenna Position Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07318v2)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can improve the communication and sensing performance via flexible antenna movement over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. First, we consider the downlink multiuser communication, where each user is randomly distributed within a given three-dimensional zone with local movement. To reduce the overhead of frequent antenna movement, the antenna position vector (APV) is designed based on users' statistical channel state information (CSI), so that the antennas only need to be moved in a large timescale. Then, for target sensing, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the estimation mean square error for different spatial angles of arrival (AoAs) are derived as functions of MAs' positions. Based on the above, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the expected minimum achievable rate among all communication users, with given constraints on the maximum acceptable CRB thresholds for target sensing. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize one of the horizontal and vertical APVs of the MA array with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MA arrays can significantly enlarge the trade-off region between communication and sensing performance compared to conventional FPA arrays with different inter-antenna spacing. It is also revealed that the steering vectors of the designed MA arrays exhibit low correlation in the angular domain, thus effectively reducing channel correlation among communication users to enhance their achievable rates, while alleviating ambiguity in target angle estimation to achieve improved sensing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While with limited microphone arrays, developing a compact multi-channel speech enhancement system remains challenging, especially in extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this issue, we propose a triple-steering spatial selection method, a flexible framework that uses three steering vectors to guide enhancement and determine the enhancement range. Specifically, we introduce a causal-directed U-Net (CDUNet) model, which takes raw multi-channel speech and the desired enhancement width as inputs. This enables dynamic adjustment of steering vectors based on the target direction and fine-tuning of the enhancement region according to the angular separation between the target and interference signals. Our model with only a dual microphone array, excels in both speech quality and downstream task performance. It operates in real-time with minimal parameters, making it ideal for low-latency, on-device streaming applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

A key focus of recent research has been the design of codebooks that strike a trade-off between achievable gain and codebook size, which directly impacts beam search time. Statistical approaches have shown promise by leveraging the likelihood that certain beam directions (equivalently, sets of phase-shifter configurations) are more probable than others. Such approaches are shown to be valid for static, non-rotating transmission stations such as base stations. However, for the case of user terminals that are constantly changing orientation, the possible phase-shifter configurations become equally probable, rendering statistical methods less relevant. On the other hand, user terminals come with a large number of possible steering vector configurations, which can span up to six orders of magnitude. Therefore, efficient solutions to reduce the codebook size (set of possible steering vectors) without compromising array gain are needed. We address this challenge by proposing a novel and practical codebook refinement technique, aiming to reduce the codebook size while maintaining array gain within $\gamma$ dB of the maximum achievable gain at any random orientation of the user terminal. We project that a steering vector at a given angle could effectively cover adjacent angles with a small gain loss compared to the maximum achievable gain. We demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to reduce the codebook size from $1024^{16}$ to just a few configurations (e.g., less than ten), covering all angles while maintaining the gain within $\gamma=3$ dB of the maximum achievable gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.</p></details> |  |

However, recent researches reveal safety-aligned LLMs prone to reject benign queries due to the exaggerated safety issue, limiting their helpfulness. In this paper, we propose a Safety-Conscious Activation Steering (SCANS) method to mitigate the exaggerated safety concerns in aligned LLMs. First, SCANS extracts the refusal steering vectors within the activation space and utilizes vocabulary projection to anchor some specific safety-critical layers which influence model refusal behavior. Second, by tracking the hidden state transition, SCANS identifies the steering direction and steers the model behavior accordingly, achieving a balance between exaggerated safety and adequate safety. Experiments show that SCANS achieves new state-of-the-art performance on XSTest and OKTest benchmarks, without impairing their defense capability against harmful queries and maintaining almost unchanged model capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted to AAAI 2025. 14 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

Existing works primarily treat LLMs' activations as points in space and modify them by adding steering vectors. However, this approach is limited in its ability to achieve greater performance improvement while maintaining the necessary consistency of activation magnitudes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel editing method that views activations in terms of their directions and magnitudes. Our method, named Householder Pseudo-Rotation (HPR), mimics the rotation transformation, thus preserving activation norms and resulting in an improved performance on various safety benchmarks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

Adding steering vectors to the model is a promising method of model control that is easier than finetuning, and may be more robust than prompting. However, it can be difficult to anticipate the effects of steering vectors produced by methods such as CAA [Panickssery et al., 2024] or the direct use of SAE latents [Templeton et al., 2024]. In our work, we address this issue by using SAEs to measure the effects of steering vectors, giving us a method that can be used to understand the causal effect of any steering vector intervention. We use this method for measuring causal effects to develop an improved steering method, SAE-Targeted Steering (SAE-TS), which finds steering vectors to target specific SAE features while minimizing unintended side effects. We show that overall, SAE-TS balances steering effects with coherence better than CAA and SAE feature steering, when evaluated on a range of tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 maintext pages and 9 appendix pages</p></details> |

However, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) may offer a potential method to interpret steering vectors, recent findings show that SAE-reconstructed vectors often lack the steering properties of the original vectors. This paper investigates why directly applying SAEs to steering vectors yields misleading decompositions, identifying two reasons: (1) steering vectors fall outside the input distribution for which SAEs are designed, and (2) steering vectors can have meaningful negative projections in feature directions, which SAEs are not designed to accommodate. These limitations hinder the direct use of SAEs for interpreting steering vectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting Unlearned Information from LLMs with Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02631v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An unintended consequence of the vast pretraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) is the verbatim memorization of fragments of their training data, which may contain sensitive or copyrighted information. In recent years, unlearning has emerged as a solution to effectively remove sensitive knowledge from models after training. Yet, recent work has shown that supposedly deleted information can still be extracted by malicious actors through various attacks. Still, current attacks retrieve sets of possible candidate generations and are unable to pinpoint the output that contains the actual target information. We propose activation steering as a method for exact information retrieval from unlearned LLMs. We introduce a novel approach to generating steering vectors, named Anonymized Activation Steering. Additionally, we develop a simple word frequency method to pinpoint the correct answer among a set of candidates when retrieving unlearned information. Our evaluation across multiple unlearning techniques and datasets demonstrates that activation steering successfully recovers general knowledge (e.g., widely known fictional characters) while revealing limitations in retrieving specific information (e.g., details about non-public individuals). Overall, our results demonstrate that exact information retrieval from unlearned models is possible, highlighting a severe vulnerability of current unlearning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024 Workshop Safe Generative AI</p></details> |
| **[Controlling Large Language Model Agents with Entropic Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00244v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has prompted increasing interest in their use as in-context learning agents. At the core of agentic behavior is the capacity for exploration, or the ability to actively gather information about the environment. But how do LLM agents explore, and how can we control their exploratory behaviors? To answer these questions, we take a representation-level perspective, and introduce Entropic Activation Steering (EAST), an activation steering method for in-context LLM agents. Firstly, we demonstrate that EAST can effectively manipulate an LLM agent's exploration by directly affecting the high-level actions parsed from the outputs of the LLM, in contrast to token-level temperature sampling. Secondly, we reveal how applying this control modulates the uncertainty exhibited in the LLM's thoughts, guiding the agent towards more exploratory actions. Finally, we demonstrate that the steering vectors obtained by EAST generalize across task variants. In total, these results show that LLM agents explicitly encode uncertainty over their actions in their representation space. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of the functioning of LLM agents and to effective control of their decision-making behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Steering Language Models With Activation Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248v5)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering and finetuning aim to maximize language model performance on a given metric (like toxicity reduction). However, these methods do not fully elicit a model's capabilities. To reduce this gap, we introduce activation engineering: the inference-time modification of activations in order to control (or steer) model outputs. Specifically, we introduce the Activation Addition (ActAdd) technique, which contrasts the intermediate activations on prompt pairs (such as "Love" versus "Hate") to compute a steering vector (Subramani et al. 2022). By tactically adding in e.g. the "Love" - "Hate" steering vector during the forward pass, we achieve SOTA on negative-to-positive sentiment shift and detoxification using models including LLaMA-3 and OPT. ActAdd yields inference-time control over high-level output properties (like topic and sentiment) while preserving performance on off-target tasks. ActAdd is lightweight: it does not require any machine optimization and works with a single pair of data points, which enables rapid iteration over steering. ActAdd demonstrates the power of activation engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Timeline and Analysis for Representation Plasticity in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06225v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to steer AI behavior is crucial to preventing its long term dangerous and catastrophic potential. Representation Engineering (RepE) has emerged as a novel, powerful method to steer internal model behaviors, such as "honesty", at a top-down level. Understanding the steering of representations should thus be placed at the forefront of alignment initiatives. Unfortunately, current efforts to understand plasticity at this level are highly neglected. This paper aims to bridge the knowledge gap and understand how LLM representation stability, specifically for the concept of "honesty", and model plasticity evolve by applying steering vectors extracted at different fine-tuning stages, revealing differing magnitudes of shifts in model behavior. The findings are pivotal, showing that while early steering exhibits high plasticity, later stages have a surprisingly responsive critical window. This pattern is observed across different model architectures, signaling that there is a general pattern of model plasticity that can be used for effective intervention. These insights greatly contribute to the field of AI transparency, addressing a pressing lack of efficiency limiting our ability to effectively steer model behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Scaling for Steering and Interpreting Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04962v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the prompt "Rome is in", can we steer a language model to flip its prediction of an incorrect token "France" to a correct token "Italy" by only multiplying a few relevant activation vectors with scalars? We argue that successfully intervening on a model is a prerequisite for interpreting its internal workings. Concretely, we establish a three-term objective: a successful intervention should flip the correct with the wrong token and vice versa (effectiveness), and leave other tokens unaffected (faithfulness), all while being sparse (minimality). Using gradient-based optimization, this objective lets us learn (and later evaluate) a specific kind of efficient and interpretable intervention: activation scaling only modifies the signed magnitude of activation vectors to strengthen, weaken, or reverse the steering directions already encoded in the model. On synthetic tasks, this intervention performs comparably with steering vectors in terms of effectiveness and faithfulness, but is much more minimal allowing us to pinpoint interpretable model components. We evaluate activation scaling from different angles, compare performance on different datasets, and make activation scalars a learnable function of the activation vectors themselves to generalize to varying-length prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Inference-time Category-wise Safety Steering for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01174v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have seen unprecedented advancements in capabilities and applications across a variety of use-cases, safety alignment of these models is still an area of active research. The fragile nature of LLMs, even models that have undergone extensive alignment and safety training regimes, warrants additional safety steering steps via training-free, inference-time methods. While recent work in the area of mechanistic interpretability has investigated how activations in latent representation spaces may encode concepts, and thereafter performed representation engineering to induce such concepts in LLM outputs, the applicability of such for safety is relatively under-explored. Unlike recent inference-time safety steering works, in this paper we explore safety steering of LLM outputs using: (i) category-specific steering vectors, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the steering, and (ii) sophisticated methods for extracting informative steering vectors for more effective safety steering while retaining quality of the generated text. We demonstrate our exploration on multiple LLMs and datasets, and showcase the effectiveness of the proposed steering method, along with a discussion on the implications and best practices.</p></details> |  |

This is especially true for tasks where rule-based approaches fall short, like type prediction. The type prediction task consists in adding a new type annotation to a partially typed program, such that the resulting program is closer to being fully typed. The intractability of rule-based approaches and high cost of manual annotation make CodeLLMs an attractive solution to the problem. However, CodeLLMs are still far from being deployed on the large-scale due to doubts surrounding their reliability. To shed some light on how CodeLLMs approach type prediction, we investigate what happens when a model mispredicts a type. We show that by applying semantics-preserving edits to code, CodeLLMs are eventually misled into mispredicting type annotations. However, by leveraging activation steering we are able to "steer" the model back to the correct prediction, making models more robust against semantically irrelevant prompt features. We show that steering achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning directly on the type prediction task. Furthermore, we find that steering vectors computed from Python code are effective at correcting TypeScript mispredictions, and vice versa. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of its kind to suggest that CodeLLMs learn task representations that transfer across languages.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards Tracing Trustworthiness Dynamics: Revisiting Pre-training Period of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19465v2)** | 2024-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. Most studies concentrate on fully pre-trained LLMs to better understand and improve LLMs' trustworthiness. In this paper, to reveal the untapped potential of pre-training, we pioneer the exploration of LLMs' trustworthiness during this period, focusing on five key dimensions: reliability, privacy, toxicity, fairness, and robustness. To begin with, we apply linear probing to LLMs. The high probing accuracy suggests that \textit{LLMs in early pre-training can already distinguish concepts in each trustworthiness dimension}. Therefore, to further uncover the hidden possibilities of pre-training, we extract steering vectors from a LLM's pre-training checkpoints to enhance the LLM's trustworthiness. Finally, inspired by~\citet{choi2023understanding} that mutual information estimation is bounded by linear probing accuracy, we also probe LLMs with mutual information to investigate the dynamics of trustworthiness during pre-training. We are the first to observe a similar two-phase phenomenon: fitting and compression~\citep{shwartz2017opening}. This research provides an initial exploration of trustworthiness modeling during LLM pre-training, seeking to unveil new insights and spur further developments in the field. We will make our code publicly accessible at \url{https://github.com/ChnQ/TracingLLM}.</p></details> | Accepted at ACL 2024 |
| **[Trojan Activation Attack: Red-Teaming Large Language Models using Activation Steering for Safety-Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09433v3)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure AI safety, instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) are specifically trained to ensure alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with human intentions. While these models have demonstrated commendable results on various safety benchmarks, the vulnerability of their safety alignment has not been extensively studied. This is particularly troubling given the potential harm that LLMs can inflict. Existing attack methods on LLMs often rely on poisoned training data or the injection of malicious prompts. These approaches compromise the stealthiness and generalizability of the attacks, making them susceptible to detection. Additionally, these models often demand substantial computational resources for implementation, making them less practical for real-world applications. In this work, we study a different attack scenario, called Trojan Activation Attack (TA^2), which injects trojan steering vectors into the activation layers of LLMs. These malicious steering vectors can be triggered at inference time to steer the models toward attacker-desired behaviors by manipulating their activations. Our experiment results on four primary alignment tasks show that TA^2 is highly effective and adds little or no overhead to attack efficiency. Additionally, we discuss potential countermeasures against such activation attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM I...</summary><p>ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM'24)</p></details> |

User personas and the mechanics of latent misalignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12094v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite investments in improving model safety, studies show that misaligned capabilities remain latent in safety-tuned models. In this work, we shed light on the mechanics of this phenomenon. First, we show that even when model generations are safe, harmful content can persist in hidden representations and can be extracted by decoding from earlier layers. Then, we show that whether the model divulges such content depends significantly on its perception of who it is talking to, which we refer to as user persona. In fact, we find manipulating user persona to be even more effective for eliciting harmful content than direct attempts to control model refusal. We study both natural language prompting and activation steering as control methods and show that activation steering is significantly more effective at bypassing safety filters. We investigate why certain personas break model safeguards and find that they enable the model to form more charitable interpretations of otherwise dangerous queries. Finally, we show we can predict a persona's effect on refusal given only the geometry of its steering vector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Steering of Large Language Models: Versatile Steering Vectors Through Bi-directional Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00045v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have been studying approaches to steer the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and build personalized LLMs tailored for various applications. While fine-tuning seems to be a direct solution, it requires substantial computational resources and may significantly affect the utility of the original LLM. Recent endeavors have introduced more lightweight strategies, focusing on extracting "steering vectors" to guide the model's output toward desired behaviors by adjusting activations within specific layers of the LLM's transformer architecture. However, such steering vectors are directly extracted from the activations of human preference data and thus often lead to suboptimal results and occasional failures, especially in alignment-related scenarios. This work proposes an innovative approach that could produce more effective steering vectors through bi-directional preference optimization. Our method is designed to allow steering vectors to directly influence the generation probability of contrastive human preference data pairs, thereby offering a more precise representation of the target behavior. By carefully adjusting the direction and magnitude of the steering vector, we enabled personalized control over the desired behavior across a spectrum of intensities. Extensive experimentation across various open-ended generation tasks, particularly focusing on steering AI personas, has validated the efficacy of our approach. Moreover, we comprehensively investigate critical alignment-concerning scenarios, such as managing truthfulness, mitigating hallucination, and addressing jailbreaking attacks. Remarkably, our method can still demonstrate outstanding steering effectiveness across these scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase the transferability of our steering vectors across different models/LoRAs and highlight the synergistic benefits of applying multiple vectors simultaneously.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03658v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Informally, the 'linear representation hypothesis' is the idea that high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in some representation space. In this paper, we address two closely related questions: What does "linear representation" actually mean? And, how do we make sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similarity or projection) in the representation space? To answer these, we use the language of counterfactuals to give two formalizations of "linear representation", one in the output (word) representation space, and one in the input (sentence) space. We then prove these connect to linear probing and model steering, respectively. To make sense of geometric notions, we use the formalization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean) inner product that respects language structure in a sense we make precise. Using this causal inner product, we show how to unify all notions of linear representation. In particular, this allows the construction of probes and steering vectors using counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of linear representations of concepts, the connection to interpretation and control, and the fundamental role of the choice of inner product.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for a presentation at ICML 2024 and an oral presentation at NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Causal Representation Learning.

However, the computational intensity and memory consumption of deploying these models present substantial challenges in terms of serving efficiency, particularly in scenarios demanding low latency and high throughput. This survey addresses the imperative need for efficient LLM serving methodologies from a machine learning system (MLSys) research perspective, standing at the crux of advanced AI innovations and practical system optimizations. We provide in-depth analysis, covering a spectrum of solutions, ranging from cutting-edge algorithmic modifications to groundbreaking changes in system designs.

Effectively scaling reinforcement learning is now the key to unlocking advanced reasoning capabilities and ensuring safe, goal-aligned behavior in the most powerful LLMs. Mainstream frameworks usually employ a hybrid-controller architecture where a single-controller dispatches the overall execution logic and manages overall data transfer and the multi-controller executes distributed computation. For large-scale reinforcement learning, minor load imbalances can introduce significant bottlenecks, ultimately constraining the scalability of the system. To address this limitation, we introduce DistFlow, a novel, fully distributed RL framework designed to break scaling barrier. We adopt a multi-controller paradigm that dispatches data transfer and execution tasks to all workers, which eliminates the centralized node. This allows each worker to operate independently, leading to near-linear scalability up to thousands of GPUs and dramatic efficiency gains. Furthermore, our architecture decouples resource configuration from execution logic, allowing each worker to have a unique execution flow, offering significant flexibility for rapid and cost-effective algorithmic experimentation. Extensive experiments show that DistFlow achieves excellent linear scalability and up to a 7x end-to-end throughput improvement over state-of-the-art (SOTA) frameworks.</p></details> |  |

However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or latency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing LLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which can lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency, especially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to adapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and potential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce BucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM inference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based on sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU memory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory (OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and priority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO compliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM in throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more request load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and demonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Universal Model Routing for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08773v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model routing is a simple technique for reducing the inference cost of large language models (LLMs), wherein one maintains a pool of candidate LLMs, and learns to route each prompt to the smallest feasible LLM. Existing works focus on learning a router for a fixed pool of LLMs. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic routing, where new, previously unobserved LLMs are available at test time. We propose UniRoute, a new approach to this problem that relies on representing each LLM as a feature vector, derived based on predictions on a set of representative prompts. Based on this, we detail two effective instantiations of UniRoute, relying on cluster-based routing and a learned cluster map respectively. We show that these are estimates of a theoretically optimal routing rule, and quantify their errors via an excess risk bound. Experiments on a range of public benchmarks show the effectiveness of UniRoute in routing amongst more than 30 unseen LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient LLM Inference: Bandwidth, Compute, Synchronization, and Capacity are all you need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14397v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a limit study of transformer-based large language model (LLM) inference, focusing on the fundamental performance bottlenecks imposed by memory bandwidth, memory capacity, and synchronization overhead in distributed inference systems. We develop a hardware-agnostic performance model that abstracts away implementation details, enabling the analysis of a wide range of current and near-future hardware technologies. Our analysis spans from current HBM3 memory technology used in AI accelerators like GPUs and TPUs to systems based on advanced HBM4 and advanced 3D-stacked DRAM technology. It also covers SRAM-based designs and scaling techniques from distributed clusters with varying numbers of chips to wafer-scale integration. Our key findings for auto-regressive decoding are: i) serving LLMs requires 100s of GB per server to serve a model instance; ii) high memory bandwidth is critical for high per-user throughput; iii) exposed synchronization latencies to achieve collective communication must be around 1us else they make the memory bandwidth ineffective; iv) DRAM-based designs have a fundamental advantage in terms of system-level efficiency as measured in throughput per cost or watt; and v) hardware designs can easily reach 2000+ user token/sec but getting to 10,000+ tokens/sec will need smaller models, smaller context, or other forms of algorithmic advances. This study provides valuable insights into the fundamental performance limits of LLM inference, highlighting the potential benefits of future hardware advancements and guiding the optimization of LLM deployment strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-driven Medical Report Generation via Communication-efficient Heterogeneous Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17562v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation (MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity. To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings. Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario: varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder, coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TMI |
| **[Revisiting Prompt Engineering: A Comprehensive Evaluation for LLM-based Personalized Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13525v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can perform recommendation tasks by taking prompts written in natural language as input. Compared to traditional methods such as collaborative filtering, LLM-based recommendation offers advantages in handling cold-start, cross-domain, and zero-shot scenarios, as well as supporting flexible input formats and generating explanations of user behavior. In this paper, we focus on a single-user setting, where no information from other users is used. This setting is practical for privacy-sensitive or data-limited applications. In such cases, prompt engineering becomes especially important for controlling the output generated by the LLM. We conduct a large-scale comparison of 23 prompt types across 8 public datasets and 12 LLMs. We use statistical tests and linear mixed-effects models to evaluate both accuracy and inference cost. Our results show that for cost-efficient LLMs, three types of prompts are especially effective: those that rephrase instructions, consider background knowledge, and make the reasoning process easier to follow. For high-performance LLMs, simple prompts often outperform more complex ones while reducing cost. In contrast, commonly used prompting styles in natural language processing, such as step-by-step reasoning, or the use of reasoning models often lead to lower accuracy. Based on these findings, we provide practical suggestions for selecting prompts and LLMs depending on the required balance between accuracy and cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM RecSys2025 reproducibility</p></details> |
| **[GHPO: Adaptive Guidance for Stable and Efficient LLM Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10628v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code avaiable at https://github.com/hkgc-1/GHPO</p></details> |
| **[Predictable Scale: Part I, Step Law -- Optimal Hyperparameter Scaling Law in Large Language Model Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04715v6)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well\text{-}established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Although existing methods have explored the influence of hyperparameters on model performance, a principled and generalizable framework across model architectures and data recipes remains absent. In this study, we conduct an unprecedented empirical investigation\text{-} training over 3,700 LLMs from scratch across 100 trillion tokens, consuming nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to establish a universal Scaling Law for hyperparameter optimization in LLM Pre-training, called \textbf{Step Law}. We empirically observe that, under fixed model size ($N$) and dataset size ($D$), the hyperparameter landscape exhibits convexity with a broad optimum, substantially reducing the complexity of hyperparameter search. Building on this insight, we formally define and empirically validate the Step Law: The optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with $N$ and $D$, while the optimal batch size is primarily influenced by $D$ and remains largely invariant to $N$.Notably, our estimated optima deviate from the global best performance found via exhaustive search by merely \textbf{0.094\%} on the test set. To our best known, Step Law is the \textbf{first} that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data recipes. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community, which is expected to advance efficient LLM training at scale.

However, existing simulation frameworks, which are increasingly used to determine efficient LLM deployments, lack any concept of power and, therefore, cannot accurately estimate inference-related emissions. We present a simulation framework to assess the energy and carbon implications of LLM inference under varying deployment setups. First, we extend a high-fidelity LLM inference simulator with a GPU power model that estimates power consumption based on utilization metrics, enabling analysis across configurations like batch size, sequence length, and model parallelism. Second, we integrate simulation outputs into an energy system co-simulation environment to quantify carbon emissions under specific grid conditions and explore the potential of carbon-aware scheduling. Through scenario-based analysis, our framework reveals how inference parameters affect energy demand and carbon footprint, demonstrates a renewable offset potential of up to 69.2% in an illustrative deployment case, and provides a foundation for future carbon-aware inference infrastructure design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Workshop on Performance and Energy Efficiency in Concurrent and Distributed Systems (PECS) at Euro-PAR'25</p></details> |

Despite the overall superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value (KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck, both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only with a small amount of extra training, less than 1\% of pre-training takes. Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism, avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShiLuohe/KV-Latent.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in The 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[PRM-Free Security Alignment of Large Models via Red Teaming and Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14202v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse applications, yet they pose significant security risks that threaten their safe deployment in critical domains. Current security alignment methodologies predominantly rely on Process Reward Models (PRMs) to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps, introducing substantial computational overhead and scalability constraints. This paper presents a novel PRM-free security alignment framework that leverages automated red teaming and adversarial training to achieve robust security guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach systematically identifies vulnerabilities through sophisticated attack strategies including genetic algorithm optimization, multi-agent simulation, and advanced prompt mutation techniques. The framework enhances model robustness via targeted adversarial training with curriculum learning and adaptive regularization mechanisms. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across five state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrates that our method achieves superior security alignment performance compared to PRM-based approaches while reducing computational costs by 61\%. The framework incorporates transparent reporting and continuous audit mechanisms that enable iterative security improvement and regulatory compliance. Our contributions advance the field of efficient LLM security alignment by democratizing access to robust security measures for resource-constrained organizations and providing a scalable foundation for addressing evolving adversarial threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lightweight Safety Guardrails via Synthetic Data and RL-guided Adversarial Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08284v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples. These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse, high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs) to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tail-aware Adversarial Attacks: A Distributional Approach to Efficient LLM Jailbreaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04446v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions. Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately assess and strengthen LLM safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemOS: A Memory OS for AI System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03724v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective, showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context, requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning. MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation for continual learning and personalized modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Yet, these advances come with a significant challenge: the high cost of model serving. To mitigate these costs, consumer-grade GPUs emerge as a more affordable alternative. This presents an opportunity for more cost-efficient LLM serving by leveraging these GPUs. However, it is non-trivial to achieve high-efficiency LLM serving on consumer-grade GPUs, mainly due to two challenges: 1) these GPUs are often deployed in limited network conditions; 2) these GPUs often exhibit heterogeneity in host systems. To address these challenges, we present MoLink, a distributed LLM serving system for large models. It incorporates several key techniques, enabling efficient LLM serving on heterogeneous and weakly connected consumer-grade GPUs. Our experiments demonstrate that it achieves throughput improvements of up to 458\% and cost-profit margin improvements of up to 151\%, compared to state-of-the-art systems. MoLink allows users on Windows, Linux, and containerized VMs to seamlessly integrate GPUs with just a few lines of code over Ethernet or public networks. Currently, it supports 18 mainstream architectures of open-source large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[OrthoRank: Token Selection via Sink Token Orthogonality for Efficient LLM inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03865v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models (LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[AsyncFlow: An Asynchronous Streaming RL Framework for Efficient LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01663v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges, we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces, offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization for Personalizing German Automatic Text Simplifications for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01479v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities. Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group. However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives. In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.</p></details> |  |

While existing server-assisted methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the efficiency of LLM inference by algorithm-hardware-dataflow tri-optimizations. We propose a novel voting-based KV cache eviction algorithm, balancing hardware efficiency and algorithm accuracy by adaptively identifying unimportant kv vectors. From a dataflow perspective, we introduce a flexible-product dataflow and a runtime reconfigurable PE array for matrix-vector multiplication. The proposed approach effectively handles the diverse dimensional requirements and solves the challenges of incrementally varying sequence lengths. Additionally, an element-serial scheduling scheme is proposed for nonlinear operations, such as softmax and layer normalization (layernorm). Results demonstrate a substantial reduction in latency, accompanied by a significant decrease in hardware complexity, from O(N) to O(1). The proposed solution is realized in a custom-designed accelerator, VEDA, which outperforms existing hardware platforms. This research represents a significant advancement in LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices, facilitating real-time processing, enhancing data privacy, and enabling model customization.</p></details> | DAC 2025 |
| **[Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18232v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is largely hindered by their large number of parameters. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution. Prior structured pruning methods directly remove unimportant parameters based on certain metrics, which often causes knowledge loss and necessitates extensive retraining. To overcome this, we introduce a novel pruning method TRSP: Two-Stage Regularization-Based Structured Pruning for LLMs. Specifically, we multiply the output of each transformer layer by an initial learnable weight and iteratively learn these weights by adding their $\ell_1$-norm as a regularization term to the loss function, serving as the first-stage regularization. Subsequently, we apply additional regularization to the difference between the output and input of layers with smaller weights, encouraging the shift of knowledge to the preserved layers. This serves as the second-stage regularization. TRSP retains more knowledge and better preserves model performance than direct parameter elimination. Through extensive experimentation we show that TRSP outperforms strong layer-wise structured pruning methods without requiring retraining. As a layer-wise pruning method, it delivers notable end-to-end acceleration, making it a promising solution for efficient LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockDialect: Block-wise Fine-grained Mixed Format Quantization for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01144v4)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly increasing size of large language models (LLMs) presents significant challenges in memory usage and computational costs. Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with hardware-supported fine-grained scaling emerging as a promising solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. We propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from a formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures energy efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit usage per data, while being only 5.45% (2.69%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

We categorize the recent 63 LLM-based APR systems published from January 2022 to June 2025 into four paradigms, and show how retrieval- or analysis-augmented contexts strengthen any of them. This taxonomy clarifies key trade-offs: fine-tuning delivers strong task alignment at high training cost; prompting enables rapid deployment but is limited by prompt design and context windows; procedural pipelines offer reproducible control with moderate overhead; agentic frameworks tackle multi-hunk or cross-file bugs at the price of increased latency and complexity. Persistent challenges include verifying semantic correctness beyond test suites, repairing repository-scale defects, and lowering the costs of LLMs. We outline research directions that combine lightweight human feedback, repository-aware retrieval, code analysis, and cost-aware planning to advance reliable and efficient LLM-based APR.</p></details> |  |

As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally, creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also, building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of TriLMs, we will release the Spectra-1.1 suite and TriRun inference kernels. Overall, our work lays the foundation for building and deploying efficient LLMs, providing a valuable resource for the research community.</p></details> |  |

This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Benchmarking Robustness of Quantized LLMs in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22776v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization has emerged as a mainstream method for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs), reducing memory requirements and accelerating inference without architectural modifications. While existing research primarily focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of quantized LLMs compared to their original counterparts, the impact on robustness remains largely unexplored.In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of how quantization affects the robustness of LLMs in code generation tasks. Through extensive experiments across four prominent LLM families (LLaMA, DeepSeek, CodeGen, and StarCoder) with parameter scales ranging from 350M to 33B, we evaluate robustness from dual perspectives: adversarial attacks on input prompts and noise perturbations on model architecture. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom by demonstrating that quantized LLMs often exhibit superior robustness compared to their full-precision counterparts, with 51.59% versus 42.86% of our adversarial experiments showing better resilience in quantized LLMs. Similarly, our noise perturbation experiments also confirm that LLMs after quantitation generally withstand higher levels of weight disturbances. These results suggest that quantization not only reduces computational requirements but can actually enhance LLMs' reliability in code generation tasks, providing valuable insights for developing more robust and efficient LLM deployment strategies.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[BLOCKS: Blockchain-supported Cross-Silo Knowledge Sharing for Efficient LLM Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21033v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly drawn attention. Augmenting LLMs with external knowledge is a promising solution to address this issue. However, due to privacy and security concerns, a vast amount of downstream task-related knowledge remains dispersed and isolated across various "silos," making it difficult to access. To bridge this knowledge gap, we propose a blockchain-based external knowledge framework that coordinates multiple knowledge silos to provide reliable foundational knowledge for large model retrieval while ensuring data security. Technically, we distill knowledge from local data into prompts and execute transactions and records on the blockchain. Additionally, we introduce a reputation mechanism and cross-validation to ensure knowledge quality and provide incentives for participation. Furthermore, we design a query generation framework that provides a direct API interface for large model retrieval. To evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, we conducted extensive experiments on various knowledge sources. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves efficient LLM service knowledge sharing in blockchain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19324v3)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD), a novel framework aimed at improving the efficiency of inference in large language models (LLMs). RSD synergistically combines a lightweight draft model with a more powerful target model, incorporating a controlled bias to prioritize high-reward outputs, in contrast to existing speculative decoding methods that enforce strict unbiasedness. RSD employs a process reward model to evaluate intermediate decoding steps and dynamically decide whether to invoke the target model, optimizing the trade-off between computational cost and output quality. We theoretically demonstrate that a threshold-based mixture strategy achieves an optimal balance between resource utilization and performance. Extensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks, including Olympiad-level tasks, show that RSD delivers significant efficiency gains against decoding with the target model only (up to 4.4x fewer FLOPs), while achieving significant better accuracy than parallel decoding method on average (up to +3.5). These results highlight RSD as a robust and cost-effective approach for deploying LLMs in resource-intensive scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/BaohaoLiao/RSD.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[DipSVD: Dual-importance Protected SVD for Efficient LLM Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20353v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ever-increasing computational demands and deployment costs of large language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous compressing methods. Compared to quantization and unstructured pruning, SVD compression offers superior hardware compatibility and theoretical guarantees. However, existing SVD-based methods focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix, which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of compression on critical layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DipSVD outperforms existing SVD-based compression approaches across multiple benchmarks, achieving superior model performance especially at high model compression ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outlier-Safe Pre-Training for Robust 4-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19697v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment. While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way for more efficient LLM deployment. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Outlier-Safe-Pre-Training.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores. MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23% without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions such as quantization, pruning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offer only partial optimizations and often compromise on speed or accuracy. We introduce HOLA, an end-to-end optimization framework for efficient LLM deployment. Internally, it leverages Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD) for faster inference without quality loss. Externally, AdaComp-RAG adjusts retrieval complexity based on context needs. Together with LoBi, which blends structured pruning (LoRA) and quantization, HOLA delivers significant gains: 17.6% EMA on GSM8K, 10.5% MCA on ARC, and reduced latency and memory on edge devices like Jetson Nano--proving both scalable and production-ready.</p></details> |  |

However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic, template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates, achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC, demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains, human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles. In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved 89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement. Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and validating refinements before deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD L...</summary><p>KDD LLM4ECommerce Workshop 2025</p></details> |

These agents collaborate dynamically through coordinated workflows to evaluate query complexity, decompose problems into executable plans, and orchestrate tool usage, task execution, and content synthesis. We systematically present key methodologies for realizing this paradigm, including task planning and tool integration, execution strategies, aligned and robust retrieval-augmented generation, and efficient LLM inference, spanning both algorithmic techniques and infrastructure-level optimizations.

To address the challenge, we propose a Conditioned One-Shot fine-tuning framework (COS-DPO) that extends the Direct Preference Optimization technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By direct conditioning on the weight across auxiliary objectives, our Weight-COS-DPO method enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front and is capable of achieving comprehensive trade-off solutions even in the post-training stage. Based on our theoretical findings on the linear transformation properties of the loss function, we further propose the Temperature-COS-DPO method that augments the temperature parameter to the model input, enhancing the flexibility of post-training control over the trade-offs between the main and auxiliary objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the COS-DPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including the Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment tasks, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at UAI 2025</p></details> |

Prior research has explored various avenues to enhance alignment efficiency, primarily through minimal-data training or data-driven activations to identify key attention heads. However, these approaches inherently introduce data dependency, which hinders generalization and reusability. To address this issue and enhance model alignment efficiency, we propose the Attention Localization and Pruning Strategy (ALPS), an efficient algorithm that localizes the most task-sensitive attention heads and prunes by restricting attention training updates to these heads, thereby reducing alignment costs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method activates only 10% of attention parameters during fine-tuning while achieving a 2% performance improvement over baselines on three tasks. Moreover, the identified task-specific heads are transferable across datasets and mitigate knowledge forgetting. Our work and findings provide a novel perspective on efficient LLM alignment.

Serving these models requires careful memory management, as their memory usage includes static weights, dynamic activations, and key-value caches. While static weights are constant and predictable, dynamic components such as activations and KV caches change frequently during runtime, presenting significant challenges for efficient memory management. Modern LLM serving systems typically handle runtime memory and KV caches at distinct abstraction levels: runtime memory management relies on static tensor abstractions, whereas KV caches utilize a page table-based virtualization layer built on top of the tensor abstraction. This virtualization dynamically manages KV caches to mitigate memory fragmentation. However, this dual-level approach fundamentally isolates runtime memory and KV cache management, resulting in suboptimal memory utilization under dynamic workloads, which can lead to a nearly 20% drop in throughput. To address these limitations, we propose eLLM, an elastic memory management framework inspired by the classical memory ballooning mechanism in operating systems. The core components of eLLM include: (1) Virtual Tensor Abstraction, which decouples the virtual address space of tensors from the physical GPU memory, creating a unified and flexible memory pool; (2) an Elastic Memory Mechanism that dynamically adjusts memory allocation through runtime memory inflation and deflation, leveraging CPU memory as an extensible buffer; and (3) a Lightweight Scheduling Strategy employing SLO-aware policies to optimize memory utilization and effectively balance performance trade-offs under stringent SLO constraints. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that eLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems, 2.32x higher decoding throughput, and supporting 3x larger batch sizes for 128K-token inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prefix-Tuning+: Modernizing Prefix-Tuning by Decoupling the Prefix from Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13674v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have become crucial for rapidly adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Prefix-Tuning, an early and effective PEFT technique, demonstrated the ability to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning with significantly reduced computational and memory overhead. However, despite its earlier success, its effectiveness in training modern state-of-the-art LLMs has been very limited. In this work, we demonstrate empirically that Prefix-Tuning underperforms on LLMs because of an inherent tradeoff between input and prefix significance within the attention head. This motivates us to introduce Prefix-Tuning+, a novel architecture that generalizes the principles of Prefix-Tuning while addressing its shortcomings by shifting the prefix module out of the attention head itself. We further provide an overview of our construction process to guide future users when constructing their own context-based methods. Our experiments show that, across a diverse set of benchmarks, Prefix-Tuning+ consistently outperforms existing Prefix-Tuning methods. Notably, it achieves performance on par with the widely adopted LoRA method on several general benchmarks, highlighting the potential modern extension of Prefix-Tuning approaches. Our findings suggest that by overcoming its inherent limitations, Prefix-Tuning can remain a competitive and relevant research direction in the landscape of parameter-efficient LLM adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Evaluation of Large Language Models in Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13186v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing prevalence of software bugs has made automated program repair (APR) a key research focus. Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for APR, but existing studies mostly rely on smaller, earlier-generation models and Java benchmarks. The repair capabilities of modern, large-scale LLMs across diverse languages and scenarios remain underexplored. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of four open-source LLMs, CodeLlama, LLaMA, StarCoder, and DeepSeek-Coder, spanning 7B to 33B parameters, diverse architectures, and purposes. We evaluate them across two bug scenarios (enterprise-grades and algorithmic), three languages (Java, C/C++, Python), and four prompting strategies, analyzing over 600K generated patches on six benchmarks. Key findings include: (1) model specialization (e.g., CodeLlama) can outperform larger general-purpose models (e.g., LLaMA); (2) repair performance does not scale linearly with model size; (3) correct patches often appear early in generation; and (4) prompts significantly affect results. These insights offer practical guidance for designing effective and efficient LLM-based APR systems.</p></details> |  |

However, privacy and computational requirements are problematic with commercial solutions and the use of LLMs. In this work, we focus on using relatively small and efficient LLMs with 160M parameters that are suitable for local execution and augmentation with retrieval from local projects. We train two open transformer-based models, the generative GPT-2 and the retrieval-adapted RETRO, on open-source Python files, and empirically compare them, confirming the benefits of embedding-based retrieval. Furthermore, we improve our models' performance with In-context retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which retrieves code snippets using the Jaccard similarity of tokens. We evaluate In-context RAG on larger models and determine that, despite its simplicity, the approach is more suitable than using the RETRO architecture. Experimental results indicate that In-context RAG improves the code completion baseline by over 26%, while RETRO improves over the similarly sized GPT-2 baseline by 12%. We highlight the key role of proper tokenization in achieving the full potential of LLMs in code completion.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 15 figures; Accepted manuscript for Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |
| **[TL;DR: Too Long, Do Re-weighting for Efficient LLM Reasoning Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02678v3)** | 2025-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress by leveraging Reinforcement Learning and extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. However, the challenge of performing efficient language reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and data will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

Existing compression methods homogenize head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH). Besides, a custom Triton kernel, FlashFourierAttention, is designed to optimize memory via streamlined read-write operations, enabling efficient deployment without performance compromise.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, work in progress</p></details> |

We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1) commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3) multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS). Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2) performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internetware 2025</p></details> |

The key technical innovation is its LLM-based regression model, which uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture composed of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The LLM interprets the input HDL code and then utilizes its final hidden-layer representations to predict PPA metrics. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable efficient LLM training. Furthermore, the work includes the development of an LLM-based HDL code repair framework to generate a large and synthesizable training dataset. Experimental results on the VerilogEval benchmark demonstrate that RocketPPA achieves significant improvements in the accuracy of PPA estimation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like Llama3-MetRex-8B. Specifically, at a 10% relative error threshold, RocketPPA enhances the pass rate for area prediction by 13.6%, delay by 9.4%, and power by 14.7%. At a 20% threshold, the improvements are 9.6% for area, 10.8% for delay, and 18.5% for power. Moreover, RocketPPA achieves a speedup of over 20x compared to MetRex and 30x over MasterRTL in processing the test set. The impact of RocketPPA is the potential to substantially accelerate the hardware design process by providing accurate PPA estimations early in the design cycle, thus avoiding the overhead of manual feature engineering and time-consuming synthesis flows.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this efficiency through systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2, a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4 outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks, highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>MiniC...</summary><p>MiniCPM4 Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[How Benchmark Prediction from Fewer Data Misses the Mark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07673v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) evaluation is increasingly costly, prompting interest in methods that speed up evaluation by shrinking benchmark datasets. Benchmark prediction (also called efficient LLM evaluation) aims to select a small subset of evaluation points and predict overall benchmark performance from that subset. In this paper, we systematically assess the strengths and limitations of 11 benchmark prediction methods across 19 diverse benchmarks. First, we identify a highly competitive baseline: Take a random sample and fit a regression model on the sample to predict missing entries. Outperforming most existing methods, this baseline challenges the assumption that careful subset selection is necessary for benchmark prediction. Second, we discover that all existing methods crucially depend on model similarity. They work best when interpolating scores among similar models. The effectiveness of benchmark prediction sharply declines when new models have higher accuracy than previously seen models. In this setting of extrapolation, none of the previous methods consistently beat a simple average over random samples. To improve over the sample average, we introduce a new method inspired by augmented inverse propensity weighting. This method consistently outperforms the random sample average even for extrapolation. However, its performance still relies on model similarity and the gains are modest in general. This shows that benchmark prediction fails just when it is most needed: at the evaluation frontier, where the goal is to evaluate new models of unknown capabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose TreeReview, a novel framework that models paper review as a hierarchical and bidirectional question-answering process. TreeReview first constructs a tree of review questions by recursively decomposing high-level questions into fine-grained sub-questions and then resolves the question tree by iteratively aggregating answers from leaf to root to get the final review. Crucially, we incorporate a dynamic question expansion mechanism to enable deeper probing by generating follow-up questions when needed. We construct a benchmark derived from ICLR and NeurIPS venues to evaluate our method on full review generation and actionable feedback comments generation tasks. Experimental results of both LLM-based and human evaluation show that TreeReview outperforms strong baselines in providing comprehensive, in-depth, and expert-aligned review feedback, while reducing LLM token usage by up to 80% compared to computationally intensive approaches. Our code and benchmark dataset are available at https://github.com/YuanChang98/tree-review.</p></details> | 30 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we propose FDC, a fast KV dimensionality compression system that eliminates the decompression overhead incurred in the existing KV dimensionality compression system, Palu, and reduces attention time. Moreover, FDC employs adaptive compression, tailoring KV compression rates across heads and layers based on their contributions to inference to maximize overall compression while maintaining an accuracy loss constraint. Additionally, FDC enhances the attention kernel to balance the uneven workloads caused by the adaptive compression approach to further reduce attention computation latency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that compared to Palu, FDC can reduce Job Completion Time (JCT) by up to 64%, and delivers up to 1.97X throughput under the same latency, while maintaining 99% of the accuracy without compression. When state-of-the-art eviction and quantization methods are combined with FDC, they exhibit similar improvements compared to those combined with Palu. We open-sourced the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Multi-LLM Inference: Characterization and Analysis of LLM Routing and Hierarchical Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06579v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation, summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges, recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference (HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and accessible for real world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost-Efficient LLM Training with Lifetime-Aware Tensor Offloading via GPUDirect Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06472v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process. With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves 80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentSwift: Efficient LLM Agent Design via Value-guided Hierarchical Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06017v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement trajectories.

| **[RoSTE: An Efficient Quantization-Aware Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09003v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning is a standard method for adapting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. Quantization has been recently studied as a post-training technique for efficient LLM deployment. To obtain quantized fine-tuned LLMs, conventional pipelines would first fine-tune the pre-trained models, followed by post-training quantization. This often yields suboptimal performance as it fails to leverage the synergy between fine-tuning and quantization. To effectively realize low-bit quantization of weights, activations and KV caches in LLMs, we propose an algorithm named Rotated Straight-Through-Estimator (RoSTE), which combines quantization-aware supervised fine-tuning (QA-SFT) with an adaptive rotation strategy that identifies an effective rotation configuration to reduce activation outliers. We provide theoretical insights on RoSTE by analyzing its prediction error when applied to an overparameterized least square quantized training problem. Our findings reveal that the prediction error is directly proportional to the quantization error of the converged weights, which can be effectively managed through an optimized rotation configuration. Experiments on Pythia, Qwen and Llama models of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of RoSTE. Compared to existing post-SFT quantization baselines, our method consistently achieves superior performances across various tasks and different LLM architectures.

| **[FedShield-LLM: A Secure and Scalable Federated Fine-Tuned Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05640v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources across organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It addresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated with the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive for small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of task-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains vulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient inversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized Differential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at preserving privacy, can degrade model performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method, FedShield-LLM, that uses pruning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters, enabling secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the attack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Furthermore, optimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability and efficiency. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA substantially reduce computational and communication overhead, making FL feasible for resource-constrained clients. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods while maintaining robust privacy protection, enabling organizations to collaboratively train secure and efficient LLMs. The code and data are available at, https://github.com/solidlabnetwork/fedshield-llm</p></details> |  |

However, this in turn degrades the cost-efficiency of LLM serving as common practices primarily rely on homogeneous GPU resources. In response to this problem, this work conducts a thorough study about serving LLMs over heterogeneous GPU resources on cloud platforms. The rationale is that different GPU types exhibit distinct compute and memory characteristics, aligning well with the divergent resource demands of diverse requests. Particularly, through comprehensive benchmarking, we discover that the cost-efficiency of LLM serving can be substantially optimized by meticulously determining GPU composition, deployment configurations, and workload assignments. Subsequently, we design a scheduling algorithm via mixed-integer linear programming, aiming at deducing the most cost-efficient serving plan under the constraints of price budget and real-time GPU availability. Remarkably, our approach effectively outperforms homogeneous and heterogeneous baselines under a wide array of scenarios, covering diverse workload traces, varying GPU availablilities, and multi-model serving. This casts new light on more accessible and efficient LLM serving over heterogeneous cloud resources.</p></details> |  |

However, recent Large Language Model (LLM) based AVSR systems incur high computational costs due to the high temporal resolution of audio-visual speech processed by LLMs. In this work, we introduce an efficient multimodal speech LLM framework that minimizes token length while preserving essential linguistic content. Our approach employs an early AV-fusion module for streamlined feature integration, an audio-visual speech Q-Former that dynamically allocates tokens based on input duration, and a refined query allocation strategy with a speech rate predictor to adjust token allocation according to speaking speed of each audio sample. Extensive experiments on the LRS3 dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a WER of 0.72% while using only 3.5 tokens per second.

While recent LLM-based KT methods have proposed new prompt formats, they struggle to represent the full interaction histories of example learners within a single prompt during in-context learning (ICL), resulting in limited scalability and high computational cost under token constraints. In this work, we present \textit{LLM-based Option-weighted Knowledge Tracing (LOKT)}, a simple yet effective framework that encodes the interaction histories of example learners in context as \textit{textual categorical option weights (TCOW)}. TCOW are semantic labels (e.g., ``inadequate'') assigned to the options selected by learners when answering questions, enhancing the interpretability of LLMs. Experiments on multiple-choice datasets show that LOKT outperforms existing non-LLM and LLM-based KT models in both cold-start and warm-start settings. Moreover, LOKT enables scalable and cost-efficient inference, achieving strong performance even under strict token constraints.

LLMs pre-trained on general corpora often hallucinate when handling personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect or outdated responses. Knowledge editing addresses this by identifying and adjusting a small crucial portion of model weights, without compromising the general knowledge. However, prior knowledge editing methods are impractical to run on local devices due to the resource-heavy backpropagation (BP) needed for updates. We present MobiEdit, the first mobile knowledge editing framework that enables efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. MobiEdit replaces full-precision BP with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, thus compatible with the energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). MobiEdit replaces full-precision backpropagation with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile NPUs. To further improve gradient estimation efficiency, we introduce two optimizations: an early stoping mechanism that adaptively terminates editing upon success and a prefix cache that reuses computation across steps. Our approach enables real-time editing of a 3B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct) on COTS mobile devices with 7.6$\times$ less memory, 14.7 $\times$ less energy and 3.6$\times$ less latency compared to previous knowledge editing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[KVPR: Efficient LLM Inference with I/O-Aware KV Cache Partial Recomputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17089v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally demanding. To reduce the cost of auto-regressive decoding, Key-Value (KV) cache is used to store intermediate activations, which significantly lowers the computational overhead for token generation. However, the memory required for the KV cache grows rapidly, often exceeding the capacity of GPU memory. A cost-effective alternative is to offload KV cache to CPU memory, which alleviates GPU memory pressure, but shifts the bottleneck to the limited bandwidth of the PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. Existing methods attempt to address these issues by overlapping GPU computation with I/O or employing CPU-GPU heterogeneous execution, but they are hindered by excessive data movement and dependence on CPU capabilities. Fully overlapping PCIe communication latency gets challenging as the size of the KV cache grows and/or the GPU compute capabilities increase. In this paper, we introduce KVPR, an efficient I/O-aware LLM inference method where the CPU first transfers a partial set of activations, from which the GPU can start recomputing the KV cache values. While the GPU recomputes the partial KV cache, the remaining portion of the KV cache is transferred concurrently from the CPU. This approach overlaps GPU recomputation with KV cache transfer to minimize idle GPU time and maximize inference performance. KVPR is fully automated by integrating a profiler module that utilizes input characteristics and system hardware information, a scheduler module to optimize the distribution of computation and communication workloads, and a runtime module to efficiently execute the derived execution plan. Experimental results show that KVPR achieves up to 35.8% lower latency and 46.2% higher throughput during decoding compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

To develop affordable and effective LLM-based recommender systems, we focus on the task of coreset selection which identifies a small subset of fine-tuning data to optimize the test loss, thereby facilitating efficient LLMs' fine-tuning. Although there exist some intuitive solutions of subset selection, including distribution-based and importance-based approaches, they often lead to suboptimal performance due to the misalignment with downstream fine-tuning objectives or weak generalization ability caused by individual-level sample selection. To overcome these challenges, we propose GORACS, which is a novel Group-level Optimal tRAnsport-guided Coreset Selection framework for LLM-based recommender systems. GORACS is designed based on two key principles for coreset selection: 1) selecting the subsets that minimize the test loss to align with fine-tuning objectives, and 2) enhancing model generalization through group-level data selection. Corresponding to these two principles, GORACS has two key components: 1) a Proxy Optimization Objective (POO) leveraging optimal transport and gradient information to bound the intractable test loss, thus reducing computational costs by avoiding repeated LLM retraining, and 2) a two-stage Initialization-Then-Refinement Algorithm (ITRA) for efficient group-level selection. Our extensive experiments across diverse recommendation datasets and tasks validate that GORACS significantly reduces fine-tuning costs of LLMs while achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines and full data training. The source code of GORACS are available at https://github.com/Mithas-114/GORACS.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

While most works focus on approximating the scaled dot product, the memory consumption of the linear projections that compute the $Q$, $K$, and $V$ tensors from the input $x$ is often overlooked. To address this, we propose Point-Approximate Matrix Multiplication (PAMM), a novel tensor compression technique that reduces memory consumption of the $Q,K,V$ projections in attention layers by a factor of up to $\times 512$, effectively erasing their memory footprint, while achieving similar or better final perplexity. PAMM is fully composable with efficient attention techniques such as FlashAttention, making it a practical and complementary method for memory-efficient LLM training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Response-Level Rewards Are All You Need for Online Reinforcement Learning in LLMs: A Mathematical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02553v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e., intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward, while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not, for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency, and holds promise for broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[LENSLLM: Unveiling Fine-Tuning Dynamics for LLM Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03793v3)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at LensLLM.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML'2025</p></details> |

However, real-world deployment remains challenging due to the high computational and communication demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on clients with data and system resources that are heterogeneous and constrained. In such settings, the global model's performance is often bottlenecked by the weakest clients and further degraded by the non-IID nature of local data. Although existing methods leverage parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce communication and computation overhead, they often fail to simultaneously ensure accurate aggregation of low-rank updates and maintain low system costs, thereby hindering overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose AFLoRA, an adaptive and lightweight federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs. AFLoRA decouples shared and client-specific updates to reduce overhead and improve aggregation accuracy, incorporates diagonal matrix-based rank pruning to better utilize local resources, and employs rank-aware aggregation with public data refinement to strengthen generalization under data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, providing a practical solution for efficient LLM adaptation in heterogeneous environments in the real world.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace, enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity. Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20% compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, solving reasoning tasks often requires an LLM to generate long sequences, incurring $O(N)$ time and memory complexities per token, where $N$ is the current sequence length. To reduce complexities, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose to retain Key-Value (KV) vectors, the intermediate representations of only the most critical tokens. However, these algorithms struggle with the "impossible trinity" of accuracy, time, and memory. For example, the state-of-the-art algorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with $O(L)$ time but $O(N)$ memory ($L$ is the cache budget, $L \ll N$). To address the "impossible trinity", in this paper, we identify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks, where milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are utilized, and then become unimportant afterward. Based on this pattern, we propose a new algorithm RaaS that identifies milestone tokens and retains their KV vectors until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with $O(L)$ time and $O(L)$ memory complexities.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Star Attention, a two-phase block-sparse approximation that improves computational efficiency by sharding attention across multiple hosts while minimizing communication overhead. In the first phase, the context is processed using blockwise-local attention across hosts, in parallel. In the second phase, query and response tokens attend to all prior cached tokens through sequence-global attention. Star Attention integrates seamlessly with most Transformer-based LLMs trained with global attention, reducing memory requirements and inference time by up to 11x while preserving 97-100% of accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

As the use of LLMs continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.</p></details> |  |
| **[NestedFP: High-Performance, Memory-Efficient Dual-Precision Floating Point Support for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02024v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a crucial role in latency-critical, high-throughput services like virtual assistants and code generation. While techniques such as continuous batching and paged attention address service-level objectives (SLOs), and quantization methods accelerate inference, the dynamic and efficient adaptation of precision at runtime remains a significant, largely underexplored challenge. The emergence of hardware support for FP8 arithmetic, offering up to 2x the throughput of FP16, presents an attractive opportunity for interactive LLM serving. However, current approaches like co-deploying FP8 and FP16 models suffer from increased storage overhead and fail to unlock FP8's full potential. To address these limitations, we introduce NestedFP, a novel precision-adaptive serving technique enabling seamless FP8 and FP16 inference from a single 16-bit model representation, thereby incurring no additional memory cost. NestedFP decomposes each FP16 weight into two 8-bit components, facilitating efficient FP8 execution while preserving full FP16 accuracy. We demonstrate the practical viability of our approach by implementing a custom CUTLASS-based GEMM kernel that reconstructs FP16 operands on-the-fly, integrated within the vLLM serving framework. Our evaluation shows that NestedFP delivers up to 1.55x throughput improvement in FP8 mode with negligible accuracy degradation compared to FP16 precision, while introducing only 3.9% performance overhead on average in FP16 mode across various models. NestedFP thus provides a flexible foundation for dynamic, SLO-aware precision selection, paving the way for more scalable and efficient LLM serving under bursty and heterogeneous workloads.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoL2S: Auto Long-Short Reasoning for Efficient Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22662v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex reasoning tasks but often suffer from overthinking, generating unnecessarily long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths for easy reasoning questions, thereby increasing inference cost and latency. Recent approaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply long or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length dynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto Long-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that enables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on the complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm, in which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when shorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed method, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY> token. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating lengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs' ability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after training. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of reasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes EThai-ASR, the first to apply large language models (LLMs) to Thai ASR and create an efficient LLM-based ASR system. EThai-ASR comprises a speech encoder, a connection module and a Thai LLM decoder. To address the data scarcity and obtain a powerful speech encoder, EThai-ASR introduces a self-evolving data refinement strategy to refine weak labels, yielding an enhanced speech encoder. Moreover, we propose a pluggable sequence compression module used in the connection module with three modes designed to reduce the sequence length, thus decreasing computational demands while maintaining decent performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EThai-ASR has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in multiple datasets.

Recent advances in LLM pruning aim to reduce the size and computational cost of these models. However, existing methods often suffer from either suboptimal pruning performance or low time efficiency during the pruning process. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective pruning method that simultaneously achieves high pruning performance and fast pruning speed with improved calibration efficiency. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) An activation cosine similarity loss-guided pruning metric, which considers the angular deviation of the output activation between the dense and pruned models. (2) An activation variance-guided pruning metric, which helps preserve semantic distinctions in output activations after pruning, enabling effective pruning with shorter input sequences. These two components can be readily combined to enhance LLM pruning in both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method achieves up to an 18% reduction in perplexity and up to 63% decrease in pruning time on prevalent LLMs such as LLaMA, LLaMA-2, and OPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

To this end, we first investigate the importance of different thoughts by examining their effectiveness and efficiency in contributing to reasoning through automatic long CoT chunking and Monte Carlo rollouts. Building upon the insights, we propose a theoretically bounded metric to jointly measure the effectiveness and efficiency of different thoughts. We then propose Long$\otimes$Short, an efficient reasoning framework that enables two LLMs to collaboratively solve the problem: a long-thought LLM for more effectively generating important thoughts, while a short-thought LLM for efficiently generating remaining thoughts. Specifically, we begin by synthesizing a small amount of cold-start data to fine-tune LLMs for long-thought and short-thought reasoning styles, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a synergizing-oriented multi-turn reinforcement learning, focusing on the model self-evolution and collaboration between long-thought and short-thought LLMs. Experimental results show that our method enables Qwen2.5-7B and Llama3.1-8B to achieve comparable performance compared to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, while reducing token length by over 80% across the MATH500, AIME24/25, AMC23, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

This study explores whether a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using only the most relevant text segments can match the performance of processing entire clinical notes with large context LLMs. We begin by splitting clinical documents into smaller chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing these in a FAISS index. We then retrieve the top 4,000 words most pertinent to the classification query and feed these consolidated segments into an LLM. We evaluated three LLMs (GPT4o, LLaMA, and Mistral) on a surgical complication identification task. Metrics such as AUC ROC, precision, recall, and F1 showed no statistically significant differences between the RAG based approach and whole-text processing (p > 0.05p > 0.05). These findings indicate that RAG can significantly reduce token usage without sacrificing classification accuracy, providing a scalable and cost effective solution for analyzing lengthy clinical documents.</p></details> |  |

However, modern methods often yield overconfident, uncalibrated predictions. The dominant approach to quantifying the uncertainty inherent in the model is to train an ensemble of separate predictors and measure their empirical variance. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble has high computational cost and memory footprint, especially if the base model itself is already large, like modern transformers. This motivates efforts to develop implicit ensemble methods that emulate the ensemble without explicitly instantiating all its members. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient ensembling method for self-attention networks. It is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), originally developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, and extends it into an implicit ensembling scheme, where all ensemble members share the same, pre-trained self-attention network, but have individual low-rank matrices for the attention projections. The resulting method not only outperforms state-of-the-art implicit techniques like BatchEnsemble, but even matches or exceeds the accuracy of an Explicit Ensemble, while at the same time achieving superior calibration.</p></details> | under review |

This study examines the use of LLMs in supporting learning in machine learning education; in particular, it focuses on the ability of LLMs to identify common errors of practice (pitfalls) in machine learning code, and their ability to provide feedback that can guide learning. Using a portfolio of code samples, we consider four different LLMs: one closed model and three open models. Whilst the most basic pitfalls are readily identified by all models, many common pitfalls are not. They particularly struggle to identify pitfalls in the early stages of the ML pipeline, especially those which can lead to information leaks, a major source of failure within applied ML projects. They also exhibit limited success at identifying pitfalls around model selection, which is a concept that students often struggle with when first transitioning from theory to practice. This questions the use of current LLMs to support machine learning education, and also raises important questions about their use by novice practitioners. Nevertheless, when LLMs successfully identify pitfalls in code, they do provide feedback that includes advice on how to proceed, emphasising their potential role in guiding learners. We also compare the capability of closed and open LLM models, and find that the gap is relatively small given the large difference in model sizes. This presents an opportunity to deploy, and potentially customise, smaller more efficient LLM models within education, avoiding risks around cost and data sharing associated with commercial models.</p></details> | 29 pages |

However, reasoning models inefficiently over-process both trivial and complex queries, leading to resource waste and prolonged user latency. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a self-adaptive controllable reasoning strategy for efficient reasoning. Our approach adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: first, the model learns to pre-estimate the reasoning cost based on the difficulty of the query. Then, we introduce budget-guided GPRO for reinforcement learning, which effectively maintains accuracy while reducing output length. SelfBudgeter allows users to anticipate generation time and make informed decisions about continuing or interrupting the process. Furthermore, our method enables direct manipulation of reasoning length via pre-filling token budget. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfBudgeter can rationally allocate budgets according to problem complexity, achieving up to 74.47% response length compression on the MATH benchmark while maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, their substantial inference cost poses a major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DASH}, an adaptive layer-skipping framework that dynamically selects computation paths conditioned on input characteristics. We model the skipping process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling fine-grained token-level decisions based on intermediate representations. To mitigate potential performance degradation caused by skipping, we introduce a lightweight compensation mechanism that injects differential rewards into the decision process. Furthermore, we design an asynchronous execution strategy that overlaps layer computation with policy evaluation to minimize runtime overhead. Experiments on multiple LLM architectures and NLP benchmarks show that our method achieves significant inference acceleration while maintaining competitive task performance, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pages,5 figures |

However, the considerable differences among available LLMs-in terms of cost, performance, and computational demands-pose significant challenges for users aiming to identify the most suitable model for specific tasks. In this work, we present LightRouter, a novel framework designed to systematically select and integrate a small subset of LLMs from a larger pool, with the objective of jointly optimizing both task performance and cost efficiency. LightRouter leverages an adaptive selection mechanism to identify models that require only a minimal number of boot tokens, thereby reducing costs, and further employs an effective integration strategy to combine their outputs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LightRouter matches or outperforms widely-used ensemble baselines, achieving up to a 25% improvement in accuracy. Compared with leading high-performing models, LightRouter achieves comparable performance while reducing inference costs by up to 27%. Importantly, our framework operates without any prior knowledge of individual models and relies exclusively on inexpensive, lightweight models. This work introduces a practical approach for efficient LLM selection and provides valuable insights into optimal strategies for model combination.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose the LLM-assisted Iterative Topic Augmentation framework (LITA), an LLM-assisted approach that integrates user-provided seeds with embedding-based clustering and iterative refinement. LITA identifies a small number of ambiguous documents and employs an LLM to reassign them to existing or new topics, minimizing API costs while enhancing topic quality. Experiments on two datasets across topic quality and clustering performance metrics demonstrate that LITA outperforms five baseline models, including LDA, SeededLDA, CorEx, BERTopic, and PromptTopic.

Due to limited GPU memory, existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1) GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its capacity has minimal effect on overall throughput.In this paper, we propose SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts inference throughput by 2.54x.

SoT is designed as a flexible, modular approach and is instantiated with three paradigms--Conceptual Chaining, Chunked Symbolism, and Expert Lexicons--each tailored to distinct reasoning tasks and selected dynamically at test-time by a lightweight routing model. Across 15 reasoning datasets spanning multiple domains, languages, and modalities, SoT achieves token reductions of up to 78% with minimal accuracy loss. In tasks such as mathematical and multi-hop reasoning, it even improves accuracy while shortening outputs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation.

However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks. To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Despite improvements in reasoning, the approach introduces substantial computational overhead resulting from iterative agent interactions. Furthermore, engaging in unnecessary debates increases the risk of generating erroneous responses. To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates debate based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. Debate is activated only for queries requiring further deliberation, during which agents refine their outputs by referencing peer responses and associated confidence scores. Evaluations on benchmarks show that DOWN improves efficiency by up to six times while preserving or even outperforming the performance of existing methods. Further analysis indicates that DOWN effectively mitigates the risk of error propagation stemming from the unnecessary debate process. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in delivering high-performance LLM solutions at a lower computational cost.</p></details> |  |

We propose Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining KV cache that receive high importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\times$ compared to the inference with full KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/ReasoningPathCompression.</p></details> |  |

We study scaling laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale, B/({\eta}{\lambda}D), should remain constant across training settings, and we verify the implication that optimal {\lambda} scales linearly with B, for a fixed N,D. However, as N,D scale, we show the optimal timescale obeys a precise power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a method to accurately predict {\lambda}opt in advance of large-scale training. We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast with prior work, we find both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N. Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeKV: Boosting KV Cache Retrieval for Efficient LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13109v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed with rapidly expanding context windows to support increasingly demanding applications. However, long contexts pose significant deployment challenges, primarily due to the KV cache whose size grows proportionally with context length. While KV cache compression methods are proposed to address this issue, KV dropping methods incur considerable accuracy loss, and KV retrieval methods suffer from significant efficiency bottlenecks. We propose FreeKV, an algorithm-system co-optimization framework to enhance KV retrieval efficiency while preserving accuracy. On the algorithm side, FreeKV introduces speculative retrieval to shift the KV selection and recall processes out of the critical path, combined with fine-grained correction to ensure accuracy. On the system side, FreeKV employs hybrid KV layouts across CPU and GPU memory to eliminate fragmented data transfers, and leverages double-buffered streamed recall to further improve efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that FreeKV achieves near-lossless accuracy across various scenarios and models, delivering up to 13$\times$ speedup compared to SOTA KV retrieval methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[EffiBench-X: A Multi-Language Benchmark for Measuring Efficiency of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13004v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing code generation benchmarks primarily evaluate functional correctness, with limited focus on code efficiency and often restricted to a single language like Python. To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse languages. The dataset and evaluation infrastructure are submitted and available at https://github.com/EffiBench/EffiBench-X.git and https://huggingface.co/datasets/EffiBench/effibench-x.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Multi-Grained Patch Training for Efficient LLM-based Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15087v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm for recommendation by converting interacted item history into language modeling. However, constrained by the limited context length of LLMs, existing approaches have to truncate item history in the prompt, focusing only on recent interactions and sacrificing the ability to model long-term history. To enable LLMs to model long histories, we pursue a concise embedding representation for items and sessions. In the LLM embedding space, we construct an item's embedding by aggregating its textual token embeddings; similarly, we construct a session's embedding by aggregating its item embeddings. While efficient, this way poses two challenges since it ignores the temporal significance of user interactions and LLMs do not natively interpret our custom embeddings. To overcome these, we propose PatchRec, a multi-grained patch training method consisting of two stages: (1) Patch Pre-training, which familiarizes LLMs with aggregated embeddings -- patches, and (2) Patch Fine-tuning, which enables LLMs to capture time-aware significance in interaction history. Extensive experiments show that PatchRec effectively models longer behavior histories with improved efficiency. This work facilitates the practical use of LLMs for modeling long behavior histories. Codes are available at https://github.com/ljy0ustc/PatchRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[D3: Diversity, Difficulty, and Dependability-Aware Data Selection for Sample-Efficient LLM Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11441v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in instruction tuning for large language models (LLMs) suggest that a small, high-quality dataset can significantly equip LLMs with instruction-following capabilities, outperforming large datasets often burdened by quality and redundancy issues. However, the challenge lies in automatically identifying valuable subsets from large datasets to boost both the effectiveness and efficiency of instruction tuning. In this paper, we first establish data selection criteria based on three distinct aspects of data value: diversity, difficulty, and dependability, and then propose the D3 method comprising two key steps of scoring and selection. Specifically, in the scoring step, we define the diversity function to measure sample distinctiveness and introduce the uncertainty-based prediction difficulty to evaluate sample difficulty by mitigating the interference of context-oriented generation diversity. Additionally, we integrate an external LLM for dependability assessment. In the selection step, we formulate the D3 weighted coreset objective, which jointly optimizes three aspects of data value to solve for the most valuable subset. The two steps of D3 can iterate multiple rounds, incorporating feedback to refine the selection focus adaptively. Experiments on both public datasets and the real-world Taobao Live application demonstrate the effectiveness of D3 in endowing LLMs with competitive or even superior instruction-following capabilities using less than 10\% of the entire dataset.</p></details> | IJCAI'25 |
| **[KVShare: An LLM Service System with Efficient and Effective Multi-Tenant KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16525v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in long-text understanding have pushed the context length of large language models (LLMs) up to one million tokens. It boosts LLMs's accuracy and reasoning capacity but causes exorbitant computational costs and unsatisfactory Time to First Token (TTFT). KV cache reuse, which reuses the exact same KV cache of prefixes and templates or shares similar ones but with extra selective recomputation, offers a promising way to tackle this issue. However, prior studies overlook the cross-request KV reuse and the attention deviations introduced by new tokens during the decoding stage. In this paper, we present a KV cache management module that shares the KV cache across requests under multi-tenant scenarios without sacrificing model accuracy. Our system, KVShare, enables accurate and efficient LLM serving by 1) a Dual-Stage High Deviation algorithm (DHD) that conditionally selects a small portion of KV cache to be recomputed during both prefill and decode phases, and 2) a cache-aware scheduler that prioritizes requests based on their KV cache hit rates and orchestrates continuous batching to achieve enhanced system efficiency and faster TTFT. Multi-task experiments conducted on models such as Qwen2.5-7B,Llama3.1-8B and Yi1.5-9B demonstrate that KVShare reduces TTFT by up to 9.39x and increases 1.2x of the throughput compared to the full KV recompute. Moreover, KVShare achieves 20.38% boost in terms of accuracy compared to SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Speculative Inference for Efficient LLM Inference Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10325v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative inference is a promising paradigm employing small speculative models (SSMs) as drafters to generate draft tokens, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target large language model (LLM). This approach enhances the efficiency of inference serving by reducing LLM inference latency and costs while preserving generation quality. However, existing speculative methods face critical challenges, including inefficient resource utilization and limited draft acceptance, which constrain their scalability and overall effectiveness. To overcome these obstacles, we present CoSine, a novel speculative inference system that decouples sequential speculative decoding from parallel verification, enabling efficient collaboration among multiple nodes. Specifically, CoSine routes inference requests to specialized drafters based on their expertise and incorporates a confidence-based token fusion mechanism to synthesize outputs from cooperating drafters, ensuring high-quality draft generation. Additionally, CoSine dynamically orchestrates the execution of speculative decoding and verification in a pipelined manner, employing batch scheduling to selectively group requests and adaptive speculation control to minimize idle periods. By optimizing parallel workflows through heterogeneous node collaboration, CoSine balances draft generation and verification throughput in real-time, thereby maximizing resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSine achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art speculative approaches. Notably, with equivalent resource costs, CoSine achieves up to a 23.2% decrease in latency and a 32.5% increase in throughput compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELIS: Efficient LLM Iterative Scheduling System with Response Length Predictor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09142v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose ELIS, a serving system for Large Language Models (LLMs) featuring an Iterative Shortest Remaining Time First (ISRTF) scheduler designed to efficiently manage inference tasks with the shortest remaining tokens. Current LLM serving systems often employ a first-come-first-served scheduling strategy, which can lead to the "head-of-line blocking" problem. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to predict LLM inference times and apply a shortest job first scheduling strategy. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, predicting the inference latency is challenging. ELIS addresses this challenge by training a response length predictor for LLMs using the BGE model, an encoder-based state-of-the-art model. Additionally, we have devised the ISRTF scheduling strategy, an optimization of shortest remaining time first tailored to existing LLM iteration batching. To evaluate our work in an industrial setting, we simulate streams of requests based on our study of real-world user LLM serving trace records. Furthermore, we implemented ELIS as a cloud-native scheduler system on Kubernetes to evaluate its performance in production environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that ISRTF reduces the average job completion time by up to 19.6%.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Oaken: Fast and Efficient LLM Serving with Online-Offline Hybrid KV Cache Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18599v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Large Language Model serving system batches multiple requests to achieve high throughput, while batching attention operations is challenging, rendering memory bandwidth a critical bottleneck. The community relies on high-end GPUs with multiple high-bandwidth memory channels. Unfortunately, HBM's high bandwidth often comes at the expense of limited memory capacity, which reduces core utilization and increases costs. Recent advancements enabling longer contexts for LLMs have substantially increased the key-value cache size, further intensifying the pressures on memory capacity. The literature has explored KV cache quantization techniques, which commonly use low bitwidth for most values, selectively using higher bitwidth for outlier values. While this approach helps achieve high accuracy and low bitwidth simultaneously, it comes with the limitation that cost for online outlier detection is excessively high, negating the advantages. We propose Oaken, an acceleration solution that achieves high accuracy and high performance simultaneously through co-designing algorithm and hardware. To effectively find a sweet spot in the accuracy-performance trade-off space of KV cache quantization, Oaken employs an online-offline hybrid approach, setting outlier thresholds offline, which are then used to determine the quantization scale online. To translate the proposed algorithmic technique into tangible performance gains, Oaken also comes with custom quantization engines and memory management units that can be integrated with any LLM accelerators. We built an Oaken accelerator on top of an LLM accelerator, LPU, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation. Our experiments show that for a batch size of 256, Oaken achieves up to 1.58x throughput improvement over NVIDIA A100 GPU, incurring a minimal accuracy loss of only 0.54\% on average, compared to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[LEAD: Iterative Data Selection for Efficient LLM Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07437v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for improving the capabilities and alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, existing iterative model-aware data selection methods incur significant computational overhead, as they rely on repeatedly performing full-dataset model inference to estimate sample utility for subsequent training iterations, creating a fundamental efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose LEAD, an efficient iterative data selection framework that accurately estimates sample utility entirely within the standard training loop, eliminating the need for costly additional model inference. At its core, LEAD introduces Instance-Level Dynamic Uncertainty (IDU), a theoretically grounded utility function combining instantaneous training loss, gradient-based approximation of loss changes, and exponential smoothing of historical loss signals. To further scale efficiently to large datasets, LEAD employs a two-stage, coarse-to-fine selection strategy, adaptively prioritizing informative clusters through a multi-armed bandit mechanism, followed by precise fine-grained selection of high-utility samples using IDU. Extensive experiments across four diverse benchmarks show that LEAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving average model performance by 6.1%-10.8% while using only 2.5% of the training data and reducing overall training time by 5-10x.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Large to Super-Tiny: End-to-End Optimization for Cost-Efficient LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13471v3)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflows, facilitating their integration into various systems. Many such NLP systems, including ours, directly incorporate LLMs. However, this approach either results in expensive costs or yields suboptimal performance after fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline, comprising prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression, to effectively tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Its high cost-efficiency is manifested not only in simplifying system complexity and producing super-tiny online models with enhanced performance and reduced costs in the results, but also in addressing development cycle constraints, the lack of extensive high-quality data, and limited computational resources during the project development process. In the first stage, we construct an optimal performance prototype system by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, which serves as a teacher model to generate high-quality data. In the second stage, we combine techniques like rejection sampling fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to 0.5B student models, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. In the final stage, we further compress models to 0.4B via quantization and pruning, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. Extensive experimental results and the framework's modular design suggest cross-domain capabilities and potential applicability in other NLP areas.</p></details> |  |
